	This document describes how to set up and run the GEMPAK EZ scripts.  
These scripts allow the user to quickly produce a GEMPAK plot of various 
meteorological fields.  NOTE:  This document is for running the ezscripts
with version 5.2 of GEMPAK.  This version provides looping and multiple 
windows. 

	To run any of the EZ scripts, the user needs only type the name of the 
script at the UNIX prompt.  The script will prompt you for all necessary 
parameters.  You can short cut the prompting by supplying the necessary 
parameters on the command line.  That is, after typing the name of the desired 
script but BEFORE hitting the enter key, type the necessary parameters 
seperated by spaces.  For example:

		ezrelh 700 

	There are two "set up" programs, ezset and ezarea which are used 
infrequently to specify the gridded data file and the area of interest to use.  
Once set, the user may run the remaining scripts as often as desired.  Note
that you need to run these FIRST to initially set up your display map
and gridded data source.

	Most of the EZ scripts display the data in plan view.  Some require a 
level or levels to be input by the user.  There are also cross section, 
time-height section, and sounding scripts which require the user to input 
the location of the section or sounding.  See below for more information.


****** IMPORTANT ******

	Note that you should ALWAYS run the GEMPAK command gpend when you're 
all done examining data.  gpend removes the GEMPAK X window from you screen. 
DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW WITH THE X-WINDOW WIDGET (the button on the upper left 
corner of the window).
		
gpend -		This is actually a GEMPAK program that you should ALWAYS use
		to delete the GEMPAK X-window from your display.  You can use
		the same window for multiple EZ scripts and only need to use 
		gpend when you're all done examining data.

VERTICAL Scripts

	Vertical EZ scripts require that the user specify the location of 
the sounding, time-height section, or spatial cross section.  There are 
two ways to accomplish this.  The user can 
	
	1) Enter the 3-character station identifier(s) or 
	2) Graphically select the locations using the mouse on a map/field 
         window that has already been generated using a different ez script.  
	
In the first case, the user merely runs the desired vertical EZ script, such 
as ezprof, and enters the station ID(s) when prompted.  You can also supply 
the station ID(s) on the command line.  See below for the syntax and examples.
In the second case, the user would first have run a plan-view (horizontal) EZ 
script such as ezfront and have a display on the screen of frontogenesis.  
Without removing that graphic, the user then runs ezprof to generate a 
sounding from the gridded data.  Once the script is running and all required 
parameters have been input, place the cursor on the graphics screen.  When 
the cursor changes from an arrow to a + sign, you can select the location(s) 
with the mouse.  For a single point, just click the left button at the 
desired location.  For a line (spatial cross section), press and hold the 
left mouse button at the location where you want the left side of the 
cross section to start.  Then "drag" the line to the desired location 
and release the left mouse button to select the cross section.

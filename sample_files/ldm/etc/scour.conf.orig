#
# Configuration file for "scour" utility, to delete all files older than a
# specified number of days from specified directories and all their
# subdirectories.  Scour should be invoked periodically by cron(8).
#
# Each line consists of a directory, a retention time (in days), and
# (optionally) a shell filename pattern for files to be deleted.  If no
# filename pattern is specified, "*" representing all files not beginning
# with "." is assumed.

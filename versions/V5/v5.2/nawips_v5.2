	   used for linking other drivers. If a routine would be a no-op,
	   it will link to the routine in the GN library. Therefore, only
	   one copy of the empty routine will be kept on disk.
	   Done, STJ 6/9/94.

	i. Reorganized all the code for the XW driver. The H-level routines now
	   only call the X-level C functions. Created a new default color table
	   for the XW driver -- COLTBL.XW. This will later allow the use of
	   user defined color tables. Done, STJ 7/12/94.

           error +50 to tg library when number of times exceeds maximum frames
	   allowed in a loop. Added -45 too many windows error to gemplt.err.
	   Added -13 to gdcntr.err and gdwind.err when no times in grid file 
	   to loop over. Copied to source_comet PB 8/94.

	m. Cleaned up a number of problems in XW driver: return codes;
	   eliminated the NoExpose event handling; properly set foreground
	   color when active window is changed; event handling problems

	   (From LES) Done, STJ 7/8/93.

   007.	Grid Data Plotting

	a. Modified the skip parameter to allow the plotting of staggered
	   wind symbols. (From LES) Done, STJ 7/8/93.

	b. Update to IN_SKIP for use with 007a. (From LES) Done, STJ 8/18/93.

	c. Added a routine to rearrange a globe wrapping CED or MER grid so
	   that the crease is NOT in the display area. This is only used 
	   when the requested map projection is also CED or MER. (From KFB)
	   Done, STJ 8/18/93.

	   1. Removed this change. Deleted GR_RARG from GDCNTR and deleted
	      grrarg.f. Done, STJ 11/26/93.

	d. Added a new program (GDPLOT) to plot multiple scalar and vector
	   fields over multiple times. (From GKK) Done, STJ 9/6/93.

	   1. Changed subroutine names from GDN to GDB.  (From GKK) Done,
	      LES 9/16/93

	   2. Changed IN.ERR to note FINT when improper contour levels are
	      selected. (From GKK) Done, LES 9/16/93

	   3. Fixed color bar plotting. Adjusted text review display to show
	      which functions are being plotted. Changed title plotting.
	      Modified to ignore trailing blank functions. (From GKK)
	      Done, STJ 10/13/93.

	   4. Changed text review display of times to plot. Done, STJ 4/11/94.

	   5. Fixed GDPLOT to stop core dumps when the grid file did not exist.
	      Added a check for proces=.true. after the DG_OFIL and before
	      GDBTIM. Done, STJ 10/17/94.

	e. Added a set of routines to plot a color bar for GDCNTR and GDPLOT.
	   Modified the original code from Jim Whistler. (From GKK)
	   Done, STJ 9/6/93.

	   1. Modified the label plotting for the color bar to compute the
	      number of decimal places needed for the value labels. Changed
	      other routines to update the calls to the routines which 
	      compute the number of decimal places. Done, STJ 10/6/93.

	   2. Changed the plotting of the color bar to include the 0 color if
	      it occurs on either end of the sequence of fill values. This
	      allows the first or last level values to be plotted correctly.
	      Done, STJ 10/25/93.

	f. Added new program, GDTHGT, to plot time-cross sections of gridded
	   data at a particular point. The program originally came from Tim
	   Barker, and changes from Dave Blanchard. (From GKK)
	   Done, STJ 10/25/93.

	g. Added a routine (GR_ACOL) to add a column of data to global
	   cylidrical grids which almost wrap around the earth. The routine
	   repeats the first column of data as the last column. Other routins
	   needed to be changed to accomodate this routine. GR_SNAV resets the
	   grid navigation to include the new column. DG_RDAT was created 
	   to call GD_RDAT and to call GR_ACOL. Other routines were updated
	   to call DG_RDAT instead of GD_RDAT. Done, STJ 11/26/93.

	   1. Removed the change to GR_SNAV. Added the check for the valid grids
	      to DG_OFIL, and modified DG_INIT and DG_RDAT to intialize and
	      use the addcol flag. Done, STJ 12/1/93.

	   2. Fixed bug in DG_OFIL to reset the right longitude.
	      Done, STJ 1/21/94.

	   3. Added a logical flag to the calling sequence for DG_OFIL to
	      determine whether or not to try to add a column.
	      Done, STJ 2/12/94.

	   4. Fixed a bug in TESTDG to use the coladd logical variable.
	      Done, STJ 3/11/94.

	   5. Fixed a bug in DG_OFIL to pass the right longitude value from
	      the navigation block, instead of the calculated value from GTRANS.
	      Done, STJ 6/21/94.

	h. Modified the location of the end point labels for GDCROSS. Added
	   an offset calculation to GDXPLT. Done, STJ 6/9/94.

	i. Changed the CONTUR attribute initialization from 3 to 0. This will
	   set the default to NO sub boxes for the contouring algorithm.
	   Done, STJ 6/10/94.

	j. Modified GDMLBL in GDMAP to not plot the row/column labels over
	   the data points. Done, JW 7/92. Added, STJ 8/16/94.

	k. Changed format statements in GDBDSP to use 1X instead of X.
	   Done, PB 8/29/94.

	l. Added calls to ST_FLST and GR_TLST, to parse user input for files
	   and times into lists of each, to GDCNTR and GDWIND. Cleaned up
	   both programs. Added ST_FLST to GPMAP and SFMAP. Done, MdJ 8/29/94.

	m. Modified GDTHGT to not clip the winds at the boundaries of the 
	   plot space. Done, STJ 8/30/94.

 	n. Modified GDBTIM to allow the use of times with a ":" in GDPLOT.
	   Done, PB 8/30/94.

	o. Added ability to ignore non-existent functions and vectors in
	   GDCNTR and GDWIND. The program will display an error that the grid
	   cannot be found, but will continue the processing and draw the
	   map, latlons, etc. Done, MdJ 8/31/94.

	p. Added calls to ST_FLST and GR_TLST to GDSTREAM and GDMAP. Also
	   added the ability to ignore non-existent functions and vectors.
	   Done, LW 9/19/94.

	q. Changed the number of points necessary for a contour line in order
	   to plot a label for that contour. Changed the value from 23 to 7.
	   Done, STJ 9/20/94.

	r. Cleaned up GDWIND. Reorganized the portion of the code which
	   gets the grids, determines the skipping factors and scales the
	   output grid. Done, STJ 9/23/94.

	   1. Fixed the call to DG_AREA in GDWIND. The sequence of variables
	      was out of order. Done, STJ 10/17/94.

	s. Cleaned up GDMAP to look like GDWIND. Added staggered plotting of
	   the grid function values. Done, STJ 9/23/94.

	t. Rewrote GDXGTS (for GDCROSS) to check for and read the surface level
	   grid from the file. The routine now uses DG_RDAT instead of DG_GRID
	   to read the grid. Simplified the checking for the surface level grid.
	   Done, 10/17/94.

	u. Changed GDCNTR, GDMAP, GDSTREAM and GDWIND to use the input for
	   gdattim if there is only one time, rather than expanding the input
	   into the full time. Done, STJ 10/19/94.

   008. Message Queues

	a. Modified the allocation of a message queue to work on the HP
	   workstations. Done, AC 7/13/93. Undone, STJ 9/17/93.

	b. Changed the allocation of message queues for ALL machines. Created
	   an HP directory, and modified the code in the IBM directory. Most
	   machines define the terminal name as >/dev/ttyp#< or >/dev/ttyq#<.
	   IBM workstations define the terminal name as >/dev/pts/#<. This
	   does NOT generate unique queue key numbers for different terminals.
	   Therefore, the routine used to open message queues is machine 
	   specific, with a different algorithm being used for the IBM.
	   Done, STJ 9/17/93.

	c. Reorganized the SYSLIB directory. All code which is the same is
	   back in the syslib/unix directory. The one file which is different
	   for the IBM workstations is in an AIX directory. The build script
	   has also been modified to accomodate the new directory structure.
	   Done, STJ 8/12/94.

	   1. Replace CCHECK in the AIX directory with CGETMQ. CGETMQ is the
	      only file which is different for AIX machines. Done, STJ 9/23/94.

	d. Changed GSPROC by removing calls to SS_ENVR and ST_UCLC. GSPROC
	   now uses the expanded file name returned from FL_INQR for the 
	   process name. Increased the string length in CSPROC from 72 to 133.
	   Done, STJ 9/19/94.

   009.	Data Management

	a. Added a new program (NAGRIB) to convert gridded data in GRIB files
	   to gridded data in GEMPAK files. Done, STJ 9/3/93.

	      abridged data section to full grid. Cleanup of some GB functions
	      to update the header information. Done, STJ 10/25/93.

	   2. Updated GRIB tables to define only parameters which appear in 
	      current grid output files. Done, STJ 10/25/93.

	   3. Added statements to print debug information if the flags are
	      turned on at compile time. Done, STJ 11/26/93.

	   4. Separated GB_UTIL into individual routines to handle different
	      projections and packing schemes. Done, STJ 11/26/93.

	   5. Added the ability to flag GRIB version 0. (Need to add a decoder
	      for version 0 later.) Done, STJ 11/26/93.

 	   6. Fixed an error in the PDS information which returned the wrong
	      level values for some vertical coordinates. Done, STJ 11/26/93.

	   7. Changed the GDS information from an array of integers to an
	      array of real numbers. Done, STJ 11/26/93.

	      STJ 12/08/93.

	   9. Changed the initialization of table information to read all the
	      information at one time. More cleanup. Done, STJ 12/23/93.

	   10. Cleaned up all the associated code for NAGRIB, the GB library
	       and the NA library, and reorganized the tables.
	       Done, STJ 1/31/94.

	   11. Added a comma to a FORMAT statement in NAGRIB. Done, PB 9/26/94.

	   12. Fixed GB_LAMB to use the true latitude to compute the map scale
	       factor instead of 60 degrees, for Lambert grids. This was changed
	       in the GRIB standard. Done, 10/17/94.

	b. Created a temporary program based on GDMOD to allow the user to
	   select the grid data by header information rather than grid number.
	   (From JH) Done, STJ 1/27/94.

	   1. Fixed a typo in GDOINP for GDMOD2. Added a README file to 
	      explain the existence of GDMOD2. Done, STJ 9/22/94.

	c. Changed GDOADD (in GDMOD) to count foreward when reading grids
	   from the old file and writing to the new file. Also, changed the
	   error message displayed when the new file can hold less grids
	   than the old file. Done, STJ 10/17/94.

	d. Changed GDDNUM (in GDDELT) to NOT display an error when the user
	   exits from the list of grids in the file. Done, STJ 10/17/94.

	   from SS_WAIT. Original fix from Peggy Bruehl. Done, STJ 8/30/93.

	b. Changed the order of checking for missing data outside of the
	   grid box being contoured in CCOEFF. Original fix from Peggy Bruehl.
	   Done, STJ 9/15/93.

	c. Added the inclusion of 'driver.cmn' to HEPLOT for the xw driver.
	   Original addition from Peggy Bruehl. Done, STJ 10/6/93.

	d. Added OSF1 and ULTX directories to SYSLIB. Changed variable

	      and the calling sequences. Done, STJ 3/15/94.

	   5. Added a table and the associated functions to set the minimum
	      and maximum image pixel values, so that all images of the same
	      type have the same range of color values. Done, STJ 3/22/94.

	   6. Added GOES Water Vapor images to the table of minimum and
	      maximum pixel values. Done, STJ 3/25/94.

	   from one window to another. Done, STJ 8/11/94.

	h. Added a new set of routines to draw justified hardware fonts.
	   GTEXTC has been added to allow centered and left and right justified
	   hardware text. Done, AC 8/12/94.

	   1. Added the functionality to the TEXTC routines. Done, AC 8/26/94.

	i. Added code to force graphics attributes to device driver when
	   new (different) window is activated.  Done D.Himes (COMET)
	   Copied to source_comet PB 8/94.

	j. Modified GPCLOSE to take DEVICE as input, so that the user could
	   close a given window without quitting the device driver.
	   Done, STJ 8/24/94.

	k. Modified the plotting of wind barbs to plot the flags on the
	   correct side if the data is in the southern hemisphere. Modified
	   GBARB to make the wind speed negative for SH data. Modified
	   DBARB to parse the wind speed and pass the correct information
	   to IBARB to draw the wind barb. Done, STJ 8/24/94.

	       plot skip values. Done, STJ 8/30/94.

	    2. Changed IN_SKIP to make the plot skip values odd if the 
	       user requests staggering. Changed the variable names.
	       Done, STJ 9/22/94.

	    3. Changed IN_SKIP to default the Y-skip to 1/2 of the X-skip
	       when plotting the data with staggering. Otherwise, use the
	       value supplied by the user. Done, STJ 9/30/94.

	m.  Created a new routine (GG_RVEC) to parse REFVEC and draw the
	    reference vector. This routine replaces IN_RVEC. Done, STJ 8/24/94.

	    23, 34 and 45 to create subsequent file names. Done, STJ 8/25/94.

	q.  Fixed error in call to FL_DOPN in FL_DSOP. Done, STJ 8/26/94.

	r.  Removed a line from GG_SSAT which reset tgarea to the input
	    value for garea, rather than keeping the expanded file name.
	    Done, STJ 8/26/94.

	s.  Fixed a problem with the byte swapping in GG_SSAT. Done, MdJ 8/29/94.

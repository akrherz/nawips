                           NAWIPS 5.2.1 Change Description Log

   000. Miscellaneous

	a. Removed GQMFIL from the GEMLIB/GG directory. Done, SJ 12/6/94.

	b. Added a call to GEPLOT in GPCLOSE to set the requested
	   window to the active window before closing it.
	   Done, SJ 1/24/95.

	c. Fixed a typo in GDPLOT. The coding error was not allowing
	   the vector scale factor to be set properly. (From PB)
	   Done, SJ 1/24/95.

	d. Fixed the calling sequence for GGTPNT in ATEST.
	   Done, SJ 1/24/95.

	e. Fixed computation of the x-direction grid spacing in GDXDXY,
	   for GDCROSS, for Cylindrical grids which wrap around the
	   globe. Done, SJ 1/25/95.

	f. Small fixes to NTRANS. Removed the file cssenvr.c from the
	   NTRANS source directory. The routine is no longer used in
	   NTRANS. Added more error checking to NxmBxmButtonCreate.c
	   for the IBM workstations. In NxmColorTable.c, changed the
	   variable for the location of the help file. Fixed variable
	   types in NxmColorInit.c. Done, CL 1/26/95.

	g. Fixed flag for southern hemisphere wind barbs. The error
	   caused missing data to be plotted. Done, PB 1/31/95.

	h. Added a call to DG_RDAT to TESTDG. Also fixed the output
	   for the DGGRID common block in TESTDG. Done, SJ 2/1/95.

	i. Added the TEXT parameter to the program SNTSER.
	   Done, SJ 2/17/95.

	j. Changed the size of the input string to 72 characters in
	   GG_PROJ. Done, SJ 2/17/95.

	k. Changed the number of characters read in GB_GIDS from 4 to 8.
	   Done, SJ 3/1/95.

	l. Removed a check for only one time returned from GR_TLST in
	   GDCNTR, GDMAP, GDSTREAM and GDWIND. This should not have been
	   added, since it eliminated the use of GDATTIM=LIST by
	   resetting a single time back to the user input.
	   From PB. SJ 3/16/95.

	m. Added centering of text for the postscript output of NTRANS.
	   Done, JW 4/3/95.

	   the header info once a non-match occurs. Done, JW 4/5/95.

	o. Changed the occurrences of the `pow' function in GB_UNPK
	   to left shift functions. Done, L. Oolman 4/5/95.

	p. Fixed a bug in XTEXTC for left justification of the text
	   string. Done, CL 4/12/95.

	q. Updated help files for GAREA, RADFIL and SATFIL. Also,
	   modified NOTAE.HLP to include new commands -- LUTS, LUTR
	   and WINDOW. Done, SS 4/12/95.

	r. Increased the number of pixmaps per window (MAX_PIXMAP)
	   from 30 to 50. Also modified NSAT and NTRANS to use
	   MAX_PIXMAP instead of locally set parameters.
	   Done, CL 4/13/95.

   001.	GOES-8 updates

	a. Update to NSAT to add new IR images from GOES-8. The new
	   files are from different image channels than the images
	   from GOES-7. Also, update satimg.tbl for the min/max for
	   the new images. Done, CL 11/16/94

	   observed data for Hurricane Bob test data set.
	   Done, SJ 11/16/94.

	b. Added sample satellite imagery for the Mid West.
	   Done, SJ 11/16/94.

   003.	Grid Diagnostics

	   for scratch grids in the internal grid table.
	   Done, SJ 11/28/94.

   004.	Decoding Observations

	a. Update to the SAO decoding routines to ignore all remarks
	   and extract useful information from the end of a report.
	   Done, PB 11/21/94. Added 11/28/94.
   
   005. Afos Tables

	b. Added new products for CAC. Done, LW 1/24/95.

   006.	Data Display

	a. Fixed date calculation in TI_JTOI to compute dates in 
	   December correctly. Done, PB 12/5/94. Fixed potential
	   problem with leap year computation. Added TI_JTOI to 
	   TESTTI. Done, SJ 12/5/94.

	b. Changed the contouring to not compute the subbox coefficients
	   if the user has requested no subboxing. Changed how the
	   checking is handled to find the crossing point of a
	   contour in a box. Done, GK 1/24/95.

	c. Added radar images as a valid image type and projection.
	   Done, JC 1/24/95.

	d. Added a check to eliminate interpolation of winds from
	   below 100 mb to above 100 mb to MR_MISS. This eliminates
	   interpoation to very high level winds. Done, SJ 3/7/95.

	e. Fixed scaling of data in GDPROF. The data was only being
	   scaled on the first pass. Added a call to GR_SSCL to
	   compute the scaling for subsequent frames.
	   Done, PB 1/13/95. Added, SJ 3/20/95.

	f. Removed a check for the last plottable row of data in
	   GDCROSS. The routine GDXDVV computed the last row based on
	   mapping the vectors to the regular grid used for scalar
	   data. The remapping was removed and only the vectors for 
	   the levels with data are now plotted. Therefore, the check
	   is no longer needed. Done, SJ 3/20/95.

	g. Added the symbols SKYM and SKYK to SFMPRM for SFMAP. These
	   symbols may now be used in place of SKYC/BRB[KM].
	   Done, PB 1/12/95. Added, SJ 3/20/95.

	h. Added ability to plot cross sections in SGMA coordinates to
	   GDCROSS. Done, KB 3/21/95.

	i. Added a flag to the user input for LEVELS. The flag /MAN
	   will allow the user to specify the use of only mandatory
	   level data for interpolation or display. This required
	   a change to the calling sequence for LV_INPT and to all
	   of the level parsing routines for the SN programs. Also
	   added a call to SN_MAND to process the user input for the
	   new flag. Done, SJ 3/27/95.

	j. Modified the checks for valid data in MR_MAND to look for 
	   pressure AND temperature AND height at each mandatory level.
	   Also, added a check for manflg to SN_MERG before calling
	   the routine to merge the data. This limits the output data
	   to what was read from the file when the user sets the flag.
	   Done, SJ 4/10/95.

   007.	GRIB Decoding

	a. Changed the check for equality of the angles in the GRIB
	   Lambert projection to use integers instead of floating
	   point numbers. (From Larry Oolman.) Done, SJ 12/7/94.

	b. Added subsetting to NAGRIB. The user enters the subset
	   region as GAREA. The program then computes the closest
	   grid points to the lat/lon bounds and extracts the correct
	   subset area. Done, KB & SJ 5/9/95.

   008. NWX tables

	a. Fixed the Flash Flood Guidance location table.
	   Done, SJ 12/28/94.

   009.	Color allocation and setting

	a. Added color look-up tables for satellite and radar images.
	   Also added the ability to change the LUT from the GEMPAK
	   command line. Done, JC 1/24/95.
	   Changed the color setting routines to choose a set of radar
	   colors, if requested. Changed the color allocation to
	   use 3 color arrays for graphics, satellite and radar color
	   entries. Done, SJ 1/24/95.

	b. Added the radar color set to NuiColorInit.c for use in
	   the user interface programs. Done, CL 1/26/95.

	c. Removed the allocation of the colors for button shadows, on
	   the color bar and palette, in the user interface programs.
	   Done, CL 1/26/95.

	d. See 014a. Done, CL 3/24/95.

	e. Updated color allocation for the NXM library based on the
	   changes made to the XW library. Done, CL 3/28/95.

	f. Updated the programs: AFOS, NWX, NTRANS and NTL to access and
	   allocate colors using the new mechanism in the XW library.
	   Done, CL 3/28/95.

	g. Added a new routine to query the color banks -- XQCLRS. 
	   Made corresponding changes to NuiColorInit to use XQCLRS.
	   Done, CL 4/12/95.

   010.	Window manipulation

	a. Added the ability to select a given window and make it the 
	   active window. Added a new common block to allow the
	   projection information to be reset for the active window.
	   Done, SJ 1/24/95.

	b. Changed the margin setting in order to make returning to a
	   previous window consistent with the case when the user only
	   has a single window. Also, moved the call to IN_TEXT in all
	   of the mapping programs to before the call to GG_MAPS, so
	   that the correct text size is used to create the margins.
	   Done, SJ 2/17/95.

   011.	GEMPAK station tables

	a. Changed Waycross, GA (AYS, 72213) to Jacksonville, FL
	   (JAX, 72206). Done, SJ 1/25/95.

	b. Changed Peoria, IL (72532) to Davenport, IA (74455).
	   Changed Paducah, KY (72435) to Lincoln, IL (74560).
	   Changed Monett, MO (72349) to Springfield, MO (72440).
	   Done, SJ 2/16/95.

	c. Added Shreveport, LA (72248). Done, SJ 2/24/95.

	d. Updated information for Denver/Stapleton and Denver
	   International Airports. Done, SJ 3/2/95.

	e. Checked information for Denver airports. Added
	   information for Chicago/Wheeling, IL. Added station IDs
	   for Lincoln, IL and Davenport, IA. Updated information
	   for Shreveport, LA, Jacksonville, FL and
	   Denver/Stapleton, CO. Done, SJ 3/16/95.

   012.	User help files

	a. Added viewframe.hlp for NTRANS. Updated the source code
	   to access the new help file. Done, CL 1/26/95.

	b. Added preference.hlp for NSAT. Done, CL 4/4/95.

	c. Updated access to the help files for NTRANS and NSAT.
	   Updated the help files for NTRANS. Done, CL/DP 4/19/95.

   013. Image Display

	a. Changed the satellite navigation routines to handle the
	   GOES-8 un-remapped projection. Changed the names of the
	   routines in WISNAV and renamed the file to MCNAV. Added 
	   the projection type GVAR. Done, JC 2/95. Added, SJ 3/1/95.

	b. Added image subsetting support. Added the parameters
	   SATFIL and RADFIL to specify the image files to display.
	   GAREA now determines the geographic viewing area. 
	   (GAREA=DSET will display the entire image.)
	   Also, added a warning in case the sub-area displayed had
	   no part of the image viewable.
	   Done, JC 2/6/95. Added, SJ 3/1/95.

	c. Added MCGOES and MCGVAR to be valid satellite projections
	   in GDRGRD, for drawing lat/lon lines. Done, JC 3/17/95.

	d. Updated XSATIM in the XW2 driver to clear the pixmap before
	   dropping an image, drop images faster and use less memory
	   in the process. Also set up the arrays to be globally 
	   allocated once to a large size and only reallocated if the
	   new image size is larger. Also, saved the image in memory
	   in case the user wishes to load the same image again. 
	   Done, CL 3/24/95.

	e. Modified NSAT to:
		- use the new color allocation scheme in the XW library.
		- have an Auto Update capability.
		- use GSLUTF to load a look up table for images.
		- include additions to the Preferences pop-up window:
			- auto-update time
			- `quick' buttons for lat/lon, map, etc.
			- APPLY, CANCEL and DEFAULT buttons
		- use "scandir" to determine the number of files in
		  a directory instead of setting a hard limit.
	   Made a new directory for NSAT1.2 since almost all of the
	   code was changed. Done, CL 3/28/95.

	f. Added COLORMB, ROYGBV and WATVAP LUTs to the set of tables.
	   Also added the new color LUTs to enhance.tbl for NSAT.
	   Done, SJ 4/4/95.

   014.	Device Drivers

	a. Changed the color allocation scheme of the XW driver and
	   all of the user interface programs to be more consistent
	   and flexible. (Temporarily installed as XW2.) Added new
	   structures to accomodate the different color banks.
	   Done, CL 3/24/95. Moved XW2 to XW, SJ 3/28/95.

	b. Added better error handling to the XW2 device driver. Return
	   codes were added to GEMPLT.ERR and ERROR.PRM. Also updated
	   the coding style of all of the C routines.
	   Done, CL 3/24/95. Moved XW2 to XW, SJ 3/28/95.

	c. Fixed XSATIM to drop multi-byte images. A bug was introduced
	   in the last set of changes. Done, CL 4/3/95.

   015.	GUI Programs

	a. Rewrote NTRANS to use the general XW library rather than
	   a local copy. Updated NTRANS to use the new color allocation
	   scheme. (See 009f and 009g.) Created NTRANS2.2 and removed
	   NTRANS2.1. Done, CL 4/12/95.

	b. Fixed plotting of dotted lines to the screen in NTRANS.
	   Also, fixed the plotting of text to a PostScript file for
	   NTRANS. Neither was working after the updates made earlier.
	   Done, CL 4/14/95.

	c. Fixed a bug in NSAT, and NXMLIB, associated with freeing
	   character strings. The problem would cause crashes if the
	   value of the string was not as expected. Fixed four files
	   which freed the string when it is not necessary.
	   Done, CL 4/19/95.

	d. Fixed the ability to resize the window for NSAT. The program
	   would not load the image to fit the window, and would not
	   properly set the new window size. Done, CL 4/19/95.

I.  Product Generation Changes

    A.  NMAP/NMAP2 Product Generation Improvements

      1. Added more layers to the user interface (AWC)

	   Increased the number of available layers from 10 to 20.  The 
	   additional layers are available either manually (via Add Layer) or
	   by adding entries for layers 11-20 to an .lpf file.

      2. Created a Save All action (SPC)

	   Save All is available when layering is active.  It performs a Save
	   on all layers that have had changes made since the last save or 
	   since the starting .vgf file was opened.

	   In addition, users may now specify an ouput file name within the
	   .lpf file.  If an output name is specified, then this file name will
	   be used for all Saves and the user will not be initially asked to
	   confirm the file name when doing a save.  So, this feature, in 
	   combination with the Save All function allows users to save all
	   changes on all layers with one button and without stepping through
	   any confirmation windows.

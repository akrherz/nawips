Tropical cyclone breakpoint product (TPC)

The Kelly graphic creation program, GPKGRF, has been modified to
generate an experimental tropical cyclone watch/warning/advisory text
product which will indicate which counties and marine zones are under
a hurricane or tropical storm warning or watch.  The product includes
VTEC lines and breakpoint names and locations.  At this time, the
product is generated only for Atlantic storms affecting the continental
U.S.  Product generation is automatic, based on a comparison of the
previous and current breakpoint information.  In order to do the
comparison, the breakpoint file processing has been changed.  Rather
than having a single breakpoint file which exists over the life of the
storm, each advisory will now have its own breakpoint file.

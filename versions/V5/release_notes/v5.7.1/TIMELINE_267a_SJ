Add range and interval for all data types (all)
Changes to range/interval user interface (all)

The user may now change the timeline range and interval values for
all data types. The user interface has also been modified to allow
the user to enter the range and interval as Days, Hours and Minutes.
A reference time has also been added. For observational data, this
time is the end time of the timeline. For forcast data, the time
is the start time of the timeline. The time must be entered as a 
GEMPAK date/time string. Any missing portions of the time will be 
filled in from the current system time. For example, if the user
enters "12", then the Year, Month and Day will be from the system time
and the Hours and Minutes will be "1200".

When the dialog box is first displayed, the default values for the 
dominant data type are filled in the appropriate boxes. For example,
Radar data has no default interval and a 3 hour range. Selecting the
"Default" button returns to the default values after making any changes.

Clicking "Apply" will change the timeline to reflect the user input.
The user can then apply the Skip, or click on individual tick marks,
as normal.

Auto-update for NWX (cdb)

An auto-update feature has been added to NWX. The user must first select
a data type and a location. If auto-update is on, the data will be 
reloaded at 5 minute intervals. If new data has arrived, it will be 
displayed in the text window. The current default value for Auto-update
is off.

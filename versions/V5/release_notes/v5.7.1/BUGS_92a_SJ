Slow refresh of TPC VG files, with offset text, on MER proj (tpc)

The TPC reported a problem where VG files were loading and refreshing
slowly. After further investigation, the problem was traced to 
specifically text objects with X and Y offsets displayed on a 
cylindrical projection, e.g. Mercator. This problem has now been fixed
and all TPC VG files load much more quickly.

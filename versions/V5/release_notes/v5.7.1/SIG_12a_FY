Added the decoding of Canadian domestic and international SIGMETS
to DCISIG.  LLWS, WNDSHR, and WV/SHR (low level wind shear) have been
added to the phenomenon list that DCISIG decodes.  Only the first
phenomenon encountered from the list in IS_PHEN will be decoded 
in a Canadian SIGMET.

DCISIG has been modified to decode max winds and pressure fields
for hurricanes, tropical storms, and typhoons.  For tropical
cyclones and tropical depressions, the direction and speed of
movement from the associated thunderstorm will no longer be repeated
in the tropical disturbance decoded line.
 
NMAP2 and GPMAP have been modified to plot low level wind shear (WS)
and flight levels of SFC and FZLVL.

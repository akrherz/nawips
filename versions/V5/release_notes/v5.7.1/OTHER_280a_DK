GFS MOS replaces AVN MOS and MRF MOS (ALL)

Directory, file and source code nomenclature and documentation have
been changed in NMAP2, NWX, the decoders and the LDM to support the
scheduled December 16, 2003 switch from separate AVN- and MRF-based
MOS systems to a unified GFS-based MOS system.  All MOS data is now
classified as type 'MOS' in NMAP2 and NWX, and no distinction is made
between what was formerly differentiated as 'MOS' and 'New MOS'.
References to 'New AVN MOS' have been changed to 'GFS MOS', and
references to 'New MRF MOS' have been changed to 'GFSX MOS'.  Obsolete
references to the "old" AVN and MRF MOS codes, which have not run for
months, have been removed.  Finally, the GFS MOS station table has
been updated with 145 new stations, 4 deleted stations, and 3 changed
station names.

Re-engineer library code for ASCII to BUFR conversion (ALL)

A new table-driven BUFR encoder program, BUFRENC, has been developed
which reads user input parameters, tables, and an ASCII file to
generate one or more BUFR output files.  New BUFR descriptor tables and
a master table were developed to support this code.  This program is
currently an experimental version of the code, which will eventually
replace program SIGBENC.  There is a known bug when the code attempts
to process more than one event of type storm, volcano, or radiation.

Color bar for satellite images (all)

A color bar has been added for satellite images. The color bar displays
a temperature scale, in Celsius, for IR images. All other images
(e.g., Water Vapor, Visible, etc.) will display a scale of pixel values.
The color bar also reflects the enhancement table in use for the
current image or loop of images.

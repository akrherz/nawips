High res QuikScat data (opc)

Modifications have been made to the QuikScat processing to handle the
new high resolution (12.5 km) data, in addition to the existing
25 km data. In order to access the new data, a new entry (QSCT_HI) was
added to the datatype.tbl configuration table. The 12.5 km data is
displayed in the same manner as the 25 km data. However, there are
more points per scan line and more scan lines.

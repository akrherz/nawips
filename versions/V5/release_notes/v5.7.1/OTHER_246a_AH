V.  Bug Corrections

    A.  Color coded AIRMETs plotting

	Corrected the AIRMET color-coded turbulence display problem found by 
	the AWC. If the top turbulence flight level of one AIRMET was the same 
	as the lower turbulence flight level of another AIRMET, both AIRMETs 
	were plotted in the same color when the turbulence filter was set to 
	the common flight level. This problem has been fixed.

I.  Product Generation Changes

    A.  NMAP/NMAP2 Product Generation Improvements

      1. Added user interface for Smear Action (awc)

	 The Smear function takes one or more closed figures (sigmets, airmets, 
	 or closed lines) and creates a new element combining the selected 
	 figures.  To use the function, draw several closed figures.  Click on
	 the Smear button on the pgen palette.  Now select a figure with <L> 
	 mouse.  Click <L> mouse again to confirm this selection or <M> mouse to 
	 de-select.  Once the selection is confirmed the handlebars on the figure 
	 will turn to red squares.  Select as many figures as you like.  Once 
	 all desired figures have red squares for handlebars click the M mouse 
   	 button.  The smear figure will be added as a new element, and will have 
	 all the attributes (color, line type, etc) as the first selected figure 
	 had.

	 Note that only figures of the same class and type can be smeared.  That
	 is sigmets may only be smeared with other sigmets, and closed lines only
	 with closed lines.

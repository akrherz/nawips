I.  Product Generation Changes

    A.  NMAP2 Product Generation Improvements

	1. Allow user selection for TEST products (SPC)

	   When 'TEST' is selected in the Watch Format window, Test will be
           inserted into AWN, PWN, SAW, SAW cancel, SEL, SEL cancel and  SEV
           text message products. The WOU initial will continue to have 'TEST'
           hard coded into the text message. 

	2. Fixed wind speed rounding in SEL text message product (SPC)
            
           Fixed a wind speed rounding error noted by the SPC. A 50 kt wind
	   will now be rounded to 60 mph when it is converted from kts to mph.

	3. Fixed status message bug (SPC)
            
	   Fixed a bug found by the SPC where selecting 'Final Status' in the 
	   'WATCH STATUS' popup box and then 'FORMAT' would cause NMAP2 to 
	   hang or crash on LINUX2.4.

Zoom does not work until mouse is moved  (hpc)

The HPC found that a previous fix to the Zoom action caused a new
problem. After starting the zoom action, expanding the rubber-band
box, and releasing the mouse button, the zoom would not take effect
until the mouse was moved. This problem has now been fixed.

Sea ice graphic pre-processing (emc,nco)

A new program was written to convert the TRAN text format, used on the 
CCS to send text products to the NWS Telecommunications Gateway, to
the Family of Services format, used by the NAWIPS decoders. For the
program, tran2fos, the user must specify the input file and the output
file on the command line. The output file may then be used as input
to the Sea Ice Drift decoder, dcidft.

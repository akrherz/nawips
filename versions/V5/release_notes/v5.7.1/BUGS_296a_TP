Track 296:  "Turn Source Off" is not consistent with imagery

The OPC found that when using the "Turn Source Off" feature on the Data
Selection Window with imagery data, the map projection remained SAT.  This
caused problems when switching geographic areas in the Map interface.  This
has been fixed.  The projection no longer remains SAT.  However, one cannot
select another image type in this case.  The image file must be removed.

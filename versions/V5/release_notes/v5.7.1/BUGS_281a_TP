Track 281:  Looping delay after going to the end of loop with
		LOOP_STOP=current

The SPC observed a looping delay after going to the end of loop with LOOP_STOP=current
and then starting looping.  This delay was caused by the delay value set for the last
frame.  Since the last frame need not be in the "new" loop, the looping in this case
will start with the first frame and use its delay value.

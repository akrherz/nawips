Track 285 - Configuration Management

Several inportant configuration management changes occurred in this release.
NMAP and NSAT are no longer being supported.  As such, NMAP and NSAT have been 
removed from NTL.  The environmental variable $NSAT has been removed and $NMAP
now points to $NAWIPS/gempak/source/programs/gui/nmap2.  In addition, the 
environmental variables $NAWIPS_LIB and $NAWIPS_EXE have been removed.  If you have
local scripts depending upon these, please change to $GEMOLB and $GEMEXE respectively.
The NXM library, Nxmlib.a, has been renamed libnxm.a.  Makefiles have been modified
to reflect this change.  The environmental variable pointing to the object library, 
$GEMOLB, has been added to the $LDFLAGS variable in the .cshrc.  It is essential
that this change be made in your local .cshrc or your new Makefiles will not find
some of our libraries.  Compile warnings found by Unidata were also addressed.  
Finally, a new program, gpmap_gif, has been added to our link scripts, so that gpmap 
can be run with the GIF driver without the use of GEMPLT.

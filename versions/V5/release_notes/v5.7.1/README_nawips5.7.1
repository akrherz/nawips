               N-AWIPS 5.7.1 Release Notes
                   	12/15/03 

Version 5.7.1 covers development from September 25 to December 12, 2003.  

******************************************************************************

********* VERSION NAMING CONVENTION CHANGE --- PLEASE NOTE *********

This release begins a new naming convention for N-AWIPS versions.  The version
numbering scheme now corresponds to the fiscal year (FY) quarterly release 
cycle.  Thus this release is 5.7.1 and the remaining quarterly releases for 
FY04 will will be 5.7.2, 5.7.3 and 5.7.4.  Patches, if required, will add a 
lower case letter to the release name, e.g., 5.7.1.a.  Releases scheduled for 
FY05 will be named as 5.8.1, 5.8.2, 5.8.3 and 5.8.4.

Please also note that all logs, e.g., nawips.log have been started over for this
release.  The plan is to start over the logs at the beginning of each fiscal 
year.


******* NSAT AND NMAP REMOVED FROM N-AWIPS --- IMPORTANT PLEASE NOTE *******

This release marks the end of support for NSAT and NMAP.  The executables
and source for these programs have been removed from the distribution.  NMAP2
has all the functionality associated with these programs.

******************************************************************************

I.  Product Generation Changes
	
    A.	NMAP2 Product Generation Improvements 

	1. Output VG File (VGF) Name Added to Layer Product Files (LPFs) (ALL)

	   An output file name can now be specified in the LPF for each layer.  
           It is specified using the tag <layern_output_file> in the LPF.  
           See the example LPF $GEMTBL/pgen/example.lpf for details.  If an 
           output file is specified for a layer, then when the LPF is opened 
           the contents of the input VGF (tagged <layern_file>) is read into 
           the layer as in previous versions of NMAP2.  However all saves are 
           written to the layer output VGF.

	2. Added Save All Action for Layers (ALL)

	   A new action, "SAVE ALL" has been added to the "Controls" section of 
           the product generation palette.  This action is available when 
	   layering is active.  It performs a save on all layers that have had 
           changes made since the last save.

	   If the LPF contains output VG file names (See item 1 above), 
	   then clicking the "SAVE ALL" action will save changes to output
	   VFFs on all layers without stepping through any confirmation 
           windows.  If the LPF does not have output VG file names specified, 
           then the "SAVE ALL" action will prompt the user the first time it 
           is invoked with the save as confirmation window.  Subsequent clicks 
           of the "SAVE ALL" action will not invoke the confirmation window.

	3. Comment Handling for Layer Product Files (LPFs) (ALL)

	   Comments, lines beginning with "!", can now be contained
	   within the body of a LPF.  Previously, comments containing
	   the "<" or ">" delimiters were not properly handled. 

	4. Increased Maximum Number of Layers (AWC, ALL)

	   The maximum number of layers has been increased from ten to
	   twenty.  The additional layers are available either manually
	   (via "ADD LAYER") or by adding entries for layers eleven 
	   through twenty in a Layer Product File (LPF).

	5. Smear Action Added (AWC) 

	   The smear action takes one or more closed figures (sigmets, airmets, 
           or closed lines) and creates a new element combining the selected 
           figures.  To use the function, draw several closed figures.  Click on
           the "SMEAR" button on the product generation palette.  Now select a 
           figure with <L> mouse button.  Click <L> mouse button again to 
           confirm this selection or <M> mouse button to de-select.  Once the 
           selection is confirmed, the handlebars on the figure will turn to 
           red squares.  Select as many figures as desired.  Once all desired 
           figures have red squares for handlebars, click the <M> mouse button.  
           The smear figure will be added as a new element, and will have all 
           the attributes (color, line type, etc.) as the first selected figure.

           Note that only objects of the same class and type can be smeared.  
           That is, Sigmets may only be smeared with other Sigmets, and closed 
           lines only with other closed lines.  

	   The smear action will be used for combining forecast snap shots
	   into a time smeared polygon.  This capability will be used for
	   enhancing AIRMET, SIGMET and eventually GFA production.  For
	   this release, this tool should ONLY be used for TEST and 
	   EVALUATION purposes.

	6. New Jet Object Added (AWC)

	   A new jet object has been added to product generation to facilitate
	   the drawing of jets for significant weather charts.  Currently,
	   jets are created by drawing the jet elements separately, e.g., arrow
	   line, hash marks, wind barbs, and then grouping the elements together.
	   The new jet object contains all the jet elements, automatically
	   rotates and "snaps" wind barbs and hash marks to the jet line, and
	   eliminates the need for grouping.  

	   Important please note:  The new jet object is being made available in
	   this release for TEST and EVALUATION purposes ONLY.  It should NOT 
	   be used to create operational products.  It does not create a BUFR 
           message at this time.  BUFR message creation for the new object
	   will be added in the next release.

	   Click on the "MET" class on the product generation palette and 
	   click on the "JET" object to create the jet.  Click the left mouse
	   button to place the vertices of the jet line.  Click the middle
	   mouse button to terminate the jet.  Then click the left mouse
	   button to invoke the "JET" GUI that allows the addition, movement
	   or deletion of barbs or hash marks.  For example, to place barbs
	   click on the "Barb" button.  The buttons change color to indicate
           that barb editing is active.  Then click the "ADD" button.  A
	   "Barb Info" GUI appears allowing the specification of speed
	   and level.  Click the left mouse button along or near the desired
	   location and the wind barb and flight level text will automatically 
           "snap" to the nearest point on the jet properly rotated.  Subsequent
	   wind barbs are placed in the same manner.  Wind barbs can be
	   moved along the jet by clicking the "MOVE" button on the "JET"
	   GUI.  Then left mouse click to select the desired wind barb and
           move the cursor to the new position.  Click the left mouse button to
	   place the wind barb at the new position.  The wind barb and text 
           will move and automatically snap and rotate properly to the new 
           position.  The addition and movement of hash marks operates in the 
           same fashion.  Click the "Show Attributes" button to change the 
           color or line width of the jet line, barb or hash mark.  If the 
           jet object is modified or moved, with the "Mov", "Mod", or 
           vertex select and drag actions, the wind barbs and hash marks are 
           automatically snapped and properly rotated on the modified jet line.  

	7. Default Values for Icing and Turbulence in Mid-level Cloud Box (AWC)

	   The default values for icing and turbulence in the Mid-level Cloud 
           Text Box have been changed.  The AWC requested that the initial 
           values for icing and turbulence indicate moderate levels of each 
           phenomenon, instead of light levels.

	8. Specify Location of .DEFAULT.vgf in a Table (HPC/OPC, ALL)

 	   The location of the product generation work file, .DEFAULT.vgf, may
	   now be specified.  The entry "WORK_FILE_DIR" in the table 
           $GEMTBL/config/prefs.tbl specifies the path to the directory to be 
           used for the work file.  The default value as delivered is the 
           current directory, ".".  The value of this preference may be any 
           directory for which the user has write permission.  The path may 
           include an environment variable. 

	9. Volcanic Ash Advisory Added (NESDIS, AR)

	   NMAP product generation now allows for the graphical generation of the 
           VAA text product as well as an associated graphic.  Generally 
           creating the product involves three steps that are described below.

    	   Step 1: Create Volcano Element 

   	   In order for the VAA text product to be generated, a volcano element 
           must be created.  Under the SIGMETs class, click the "VOL" button.  
           Either select the volcano name via the pull-down menu (which fills 
           in all pertinent information) or type in the volcano name and 
           manually fill in the remaining information.  Click "Create VAA 
           Volcano" to place the volcano element at the volcano location.  Note 
           that if a volcano element has already been created 
           (and issued/saved), simply select and open the VGF for the 
           volcano.  Important note: only ONE volcano should be saved in a 
           single VGF.

	   Step 2: Create Volcanic Ash Clouds

   	   Volcanic ash clouds indicate the area coverage, vertical 
   	   extent and movement of ash.  The behavior is similar to that of 
           SIGMETs, AIRMETs, etc.  Click "VAC" under the SIGMETs class. Choose 
           either "Area" or "Line", assign a vertical extent and movement, 
           and draw the object by clicking the left mouse button to select 
           vertices.  Use the middle mouse button to end the figure.  The ash 
           object may then be selected and edited.  If no ash is seen (as in 
           the case of cloud obscuration or dissipation), then choose 'Not 
           Seen' and place a text box with that information.  Important note: 
           only ash clouds associated with the current volcano should be drawn 
           in the VGF.  Ash from other volcanoes should be drawn in their 
           respective VG files.

	   Step 3: Create the Text Product

   	   To create the VAA text product, select the volcano element.  A form 
           will appear allowing input of various pieces of information. If the 
           volcano has been previously edited then that information will have 
           been saved and filled in.  All ash cloud earth coordinate locations, 
           flight levels and movements will also be automatically filled in.  
           Note that the following section's choices are table driven 
           using the table $GEMTBL/pgen/vaa.tbl and can be controlled locally: 
           Header Information, Information Source, Aviation Color Code, 
           Fcst Ash Cloud +6hr, Next Advisory, Forecaster(s).  When all 
           information is filled in, click "Format VAA".  The final product 
           will appear; if changes are needed, click "Cancel" to return to 
           the "VAA Volcano Edit" form. Clicking "Save" will save the VAA 
           text product in the filename shown as well as in the generic 
           filename "VAA.txt".  The corresponding VG file name is 
	   also saved and may be used to create a graphical VAA product using 
           a post-processing program such as GPMAP.

        10. Watch Improvements (SPC)

	   The insertion of the "test" string into watch products is now
	   controlled by an NMAP GUI.  Click on the "Test" button in the 
           "Format Watch" GUI to insert the "test" strings into the WOU
	   initial, SAW, SAW cancel, SEL, SEL cancel, SEV, AWN and PWN
	   text products.

	   At the request of the SPC, the list of replaced watches is cleared
           every time the "Watch Coordination" GUI is invoked.

	   A wind speed rounding error for the SEL text message has been
	   corrected.  A 50 kt wind is now rounded to 60 mph when it is 
           converted from kts to mph.

	   A problem discovered on LINUX2.4 platforms was corrected for the
	   watch status message creation.  This problem occurred when selecting
           "FINAL STATUS" in the "WATCH STATUS" GUI and then clicking on the
	   "FORMAT" button.
	   
	11. New Outlook Group Type Added (SPC)

	   A new outlook group type, TSTMOLK, has been added at the request
	   of the SPC.  Its attributes can be modified in the table,
	   $GEMTBL/pgen/grptyp.tbl.

    B.  Product Generation Pre/Post-Processing Programs

	1. Re-engineer Library Code for ASCII to BUFR Conversion (AWC, ALL)

	   A new table-driven BUFR encoder program, BUFRENC, has been developed
	   which reads user input parameters, tables, and an ASCII file to
	   generate one or more BUFR output files.  This program will allow 
	   for a more generic means of creating BUFR files than the current
	   capabilities.  Note that BUFRENC is being released for TESTING and 
           EVALUATION purposes ONLY.  The plan is to replace the program 
           SIGBENC in the next release after parallel testing is conducted.  

	   BUFRENC is written as a GEMPAK program with the GEMPAK text based 
           user interface.  Additional help on the program can be obtained by 
           running the GEMPAK help facility in the program or viewing the 
	   GEMPAK help file $GEMHLP/bufrenc.hlp.

	   New BUFR descriptor tables and a master table were developed to 
           support BUFRENC.  These tables are located in the $GEMTBL/bufr 
           directory.

	2. Tropical Cyclone Breakpoint Product (TPC)

	   The Kelly graphic creation program, GPKGRF, has been modified to
	   generate an experimental tropical cyclone watch/warning/advisory text
	   product which indicates which counties and marine zones are under
	   a hurricane or tropical storm warning or watch.  The product includes
	   VTEC lines and breakpoint names and locations and will be used as 
           input for AWIPS WWA program for WFO product generation.  At this 
           time, the product is generated only for Atlantic storms affecting the 
	   continental U.S.  Product generation is automatic, based on a 
           comparison of the previous and current breakpoint information.  It 
           is in a file named KNHCTCVATn, where n varies from 1 to 5 depending 
           on the storm number.  For this release, the text product is created
	   for MDL testing purposes, only.

	   ***Important please note: ***
           In order to do the comparison, the breakpoint file processing has 
           been changed.  Rather than having a single breakpoint file which 
           exists over the life of the storm, each advisory will now have its 
           own breakpoint file.  See the GPKGRF program help or 
           $GEMHLP/gpkgrf.hlp for additional details.

II.  NMAP2 Display Improvements 

    A.  Added Display of High Resolution QuikScat Data (OPC)

	NMAP2 has been enhanced to display the new high resolution (12.5 km)
	QuikScat data sets in addition to the existing 25 km data sets.  Select
	the "QSCT_HI" under the "MISC" data source to display the high resolution
	data sets.  The high resolution data are displayed in the same manner 
        as the lower resolution data with the same display attribute options 
        available.  The higher resolution data sets include more points per 
        scan line and more scan lines.  A new entry, QSCT_HI, has been added 
        to the table $GEMTBL/config/datatype.tbl to allow access to the new data 
        set.

III. Decoder Improvements

    A.  Added Decoding of Canadian Land and Marine Sigmets (AWC, AR)

	The Sigmet decoder, DCISIG, has been enhanced to decode Canadian land 
        and marine SIGMETS.  The low level wind shear parameters LLWS, WNDSHR, 
        and WV/SHR have been added to the phenomenon list that DCISIG decodes.  
        Note that there are some cases where the Canadian Sigmets include more
	than one phenomenon in a message.  In these cases, the decoder currently
	only decodes the first phenomenon. 

	NMAP2 displays Canadian SIGMETs along with other types by selecting
	the "ISIG" data type under the "MISC" category.

    B.  Miscellaneous Sigmet Decoder Improvements (AWC, AR)

	DCISIG has been modified to decode max winds and pressure fields
	for hurricanes, tropical storms, and typhoons.  For tropical
	cyclones and tropical depressions, the direction and speed of
	movement from the associated thunderstorm will no longer be repeated
	in the tropical disturbance decoded line.
 
	NMAP2 and GPMAP have been modified to plot low level wind shear (WS).
	Height levels SFC (surface) and FZLVL (freezing level) are plotted
        as text strings.

    C.  Added JTWC Advisories to Hurricane Decoder Improvements (PR, TPC)
 
	The hurricane decoder has been enhanced to decode Joint Typhoon
	Weather Center (JTWC) hurricane advisories with the WMO header
	"WTPN3[1-5] PGTW".  See the hurricane decoder help file, 
	$GEMHLP/dchrcn.hlp, for additional details.

	The JTWC advisories can now also be displayed in NMAP2 by selecting 
        "HRCN" under the "MISC" data category.  This selection displays both 
        the TPC and JTWC advisories.             

IV.  General Improvements

    A.  Color Bar for Radar and Satellite Images (ALL)

	A new parameter, IMCBAR, has been added to GEMPAK display programs
	to specify the attributes of the color bar for imagery.  The color
	bar attributes include its position, size, label color, and 
        orientation.  See the GEMPAK help, $GEMHLP/imcbar.hl2 for additional
	information on this parameter.  The default value for this parameter
	in GEMPAK programs is not to plot the color bar.  Note that in NMAP2, 
        the position and other color bar attributes cannot be modified.

	In addition, a color bar has been added for satellite images. The 
   	color bar displays a temperature scale, in Celsius, for IR images. 
        All other images (e.g., Water Vapor, Visible, etc.) display a 
    	scale of pixel values.  The color bar also reflects the enhancement 
        table in use for the current image or loop of images.

    B.  One-hour Precipitation Accumulation (ALL)

	The precipitation accumulation grid diagnostic was modified to 
	accommodate data from the ETA at 1-hour intervals. The ETA model will 
	be changed to output 1-hour time steps out to F36, in the near future.
	The precipitation grids from this output are named with the forecast
	hours for the grids from F01 to F12 -- P01M, P02M ... P11M, P12M. Then
	at F13, the naming convention repeats starting again with P01M. The 
	accumulation algorithm was modified to account for the new precipitation
	grids.

    C.  Auto-update for NWX (ALL)

	An auto-update feature has been added to NWX. The user must first select
	a data type and a location.  If auto-update is on, the data are 
	reloaded at 5 minute intervals.  If new data have arrived, they are 
	displayed in the text window.  The current default value for auto-update
	is off.  Click on "Auto" pull down on the "NWX" GUI to turn on the 
        auto-update feature.

    D.  GFS MOS Replaces AVN MOS and MRF MOS (ALL)

	Directory, file and source code nomenclature and documentation have
	been changed in NMAP2, NWX, the decoders and the LDM to support the
	scheduled December 16, 2003 switch from separate AVN- and MRF-based
	MOS systems to a unified GFS-based MOS system.  All MOS data are now
	classified as type 'MOS' in NMAP2 and NWX, and no distinction is made
	between what was formerly differentiated as 'MOS' and 'New MOS'.
	References to 'New AVN MOS' have been changed to 'GFS MOS', and
	references to 'New MRF MOS' have been changed to 'GFSX MOS'.  Obsolete
	references to the "old" AVN and MRF MOS codes, which have not run for
	months, have been removed.  Finally, the GFS MOS station table has
	been updated with 145 new stations, 4 deleted stations, and 3 changed
	station names.  Note that the previous release will continue to
	handle the MOS data sets.  Therefore, v5.7.1 does not have to be 
	installed by December 16, 2003.

    E.  GPMAP_GIF Program Added (AWC)

	The program GPMAP has been linked with the GIF device driver at the
	request of the AWC.  The gpmap_gif executables are available for all
	supported platforms.

    F.  Sea Ice Graphic Pre-processing (EMC, NCO)

	A new program, tran2fos, was written to convert the TRAN text format, 
        used on the CCS to send text products to the NWS Telecommunications 
	Gateway, to the Family of Services format, used by the NAWIPS decoders. 
        The program, tran2fos, requires the input file and the output file to be
        specified on the command line.  The output file may then be used as 
        input to the Sea Ice Drift decoder, dcidft.

    G.  Remove Data Type ATCO from Tables and Code (HPC, TPC)

	The miscellaneous data type ATCO, the ATCF tropical cyclone forecast 
        tracks in the old format, has been removed from NMAP2 and GPMAP.  This 
        old format was replaced by a new format in 2001, and had been kept for
	backward compatibility only.

    H.  Preliminary Extended Forecast Discussion Added to NWX (OPC)

        The Preliminary Extended Forecast Discussion has been added to NWX as
        data type "HPC Products" under the "Extended Prelim" category. 

V.  Bug Corrections 

    A.  Color Coded AIRMETs Plotting (AWC)

        Corrected the AIRMET color-coded turbulence display problem found by 
        the AWC.  If the top turbulence flight level of one AIRMET was the same 
        as the lower turbulence flight level of another AIRMET, both AIRMETs 
        were plotted in the same color when the turbulence filter was set to 
        the common flight level.  This problem has been fixed.

    B.  Volcano Selection GUI (AWC)

	Corrected the problem where some volcano names could not be selected
	because the pull down extended beyond the bottom of the screen.

    C.  Zoom Does Not Work Until Mouse is Moved (HPC)

	The HPC found that a previous correction to the zoom function caused 
        a new problem.  After starting the zoom action, expanding the rubber-band
	box, and releasing the mouse button, the zoom did not take effect
	until the mouse was moved.  This problem has now been fixed.

    D.  Small (400x320) GIF Images Hang the GF Device Driver (HPC)

	The HPC discovered that small (400x320) GIF images hang the GF device 
        driver on Linux platforms.  This problem has been corrected.

    E.  NDFD Decoder Problem with Precipitation Probability (HPC)

	Corrected the NDFD decoder to properly handle NDFD grids of
	precipitation probability.

    F.  "Turn Source Off" Feature not Consistent with Imagery (OPC)

	The OPC found that when using the "Turn Source Off" feature on the "Data
	Selection Window" with imagery data, the map projection remained SAT.  
        This caused problems when switching geographic areas in the Map 
        interface.  This problem has been corrected.  The projection no longer 
        remains SAT.  However, one cannot select another image type in this 
	case.  The image file must be removed.

    G.  Looping Delay at End of Loop with LOOP_STOP Set to Current (SPC)

        The SPC observed a looping delay if the loop was stopped at the
	last frame in the loop and restarted with the new feature introduced in 
        the last release, LOOP_STOP = Current.  The delay has been eliminated for
	this case.

    H.  Slow Refresh of TPC VG Files, with Offset Text, on MER Proj (TPC)

	The TPC reported a problem where VG files were loading and refreshing
	slowly.  After further investigation, the problem was traced to 
	text objects with X and Y offsets displayed on a cylindrical projection, 
        e.g. Mercator.  This problem has now been corrected and all TPC VG files 
        load much more quickly.

VI. Known Bugs  

    A.  Default Button In Custom Map Definition GUI (ALL)

        The "DEF Content" button in the "Custom Map Definition" GUI
        does not work.  It is supposed to list the default map
        projection for selected geographic regions.

VII. Map and Table File Updates

    The following summarizes significant table changes.  See 
    $NAWIPS/versions/tables.log and nawips.log for a complete list of all 
    table and map file changes. 

    A.  Preferences Table Change for Addition of .DEFAULT.vgf Location (ALL)
	
	A new entry, WORK_FILE_DIR, has been added to the table 
	$GEMTBL/config/prefs.tbl to specify the path to the directory that
	contains the NMAP2 product generation working directory.  Site versions
	of the prefs.tbl MUST be updated to include this entry for proper
	product generation operations. 

    B.  Settings Table Change for New Jet Object (AWC, ALL)

	A new entry has been added to the table $GEMTBL/pgen/setting.tbl for
	the jet element under the MET class.  This entry MUST be added to

IX. Configuration Management Changes 

       ***** Site Administrators Important Please Note ****

Several important configuration management changes occurred in this release.
As noted at the beginning of these release notes, NMAP and NSAT are no longer 
supported.  As such, NMAP and NSAT have been removed from NTL.  The environmental 
variable $NSAT has been removed and $NMAP now points to 
$NAWIPS/gempak/source/programs/gui/nmap2.  

Two environmental variables $NAWIPS_LIB and $NAWIPS_EXE have been removed.  If 
you have local scripts depending upon these, please change them to $GEMOLB and 
$GEMEXE, respectively.

The NXM library, Nxmlib.a, has been renamed libnxm.a.  Makefiles have been 
modified to reflect this change.  

The environmental variable pointing to the object library, $GEMOLB, has been 
added to the $LDFLAGS variable in the .cshrc.  Site administrators MUST make 
this change to their local dot files to ensure that NAWIPS will build 
properly.  Sample .cshrc, .login and .profile files are provided with this 
release which include the necessary changes.  They are named with the 
"_5.7.1 extension.

Compile warnings found by Unidata were also addressed in this release.  

*****************************************************************************


The necessary compiling and linking instructions are contained in
the following file:

     release_build_5.7.1 

To execute the script and save its output in a file type:

     cd $GEMPAK/build
     release_build_5.7.1 >&! RELEASE_$NA_OS & ; tail -f RELEASE_$NA_OS

The output of the script will be written to RELEASE_$NA_OS.

Note that the build script removes files that have been eliminated in
this version.  These files must be removed by hand if the build script
is not executed.  A list of removed files for each release always appears
in the file: $NAWIPS/versions/remove.log.

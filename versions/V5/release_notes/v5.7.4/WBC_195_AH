Watch-By-County

	A. County - Marine Zone centriod locations (SPC)

	Fixed a problem where some centroids were not located in the
	correct county or marine zone. Added checks when creating the
	maps and bounds files to check if the centroid is properly 
	located. 

	B. Checks on Watch Format GUI entries (SPC)
	
	Added checks to the Watch Format GUI to:
	    1. check the current watch number against the list of watch 
	       replacement numbers. If the current watch number is in
	       the replacement watch number list, a warning message
	       will appear.
	    2. check whether the current number has already been used. If
	       it has been used, the user will be asked if they wish to
	       overwrite the files.
	    3. check that the WSM check box for reference mesoscale 
	       discussion is toggled off when the GUI pops up.

	C. Updated the enhanced WSM and status message display (SPC)

	Added to the enhanced WSM a line containing the watch type and
	watch number. "STATUS REPORT FOR W? ####".  In the enhanced 
	watch status message, checked the tag variable ADD_WSM_WS_WT to 
	check if the line: "STATUS REPORT FOR W? ####" should be added 
	in the WSM text message. TRUE, it should be added and FALSE, it 
	should not be added. This tag variable is found in 
	$GEMTBL/config/prefs.tbl.
    
	Also, replaced the old WSM with the enhanced WSM in the Watch 
	Status Save GUI.  Both WSM text files are still saved to the 
	local directory.

Graph-to-Grid

	A. Added vector information to .info file

	Wind barb and vector information (speed, direction, location, etc.) has 
	been added to the information file, '*.info'. This information is in 
	preparation for later development of generating U and V grids from 
	randomly placed wind barbs/vectors. The additional information should 
	not impact the current performance or capabilities.

Converted New Jet Element from ASCII to VGF (AWC)

Program SIGAVGF, which converts SIGWX data from the UKMET browsable
ASCII format to a VG file, will now create jet elements instead of
grouped jets.  This means that flight level deltas can now be
included as part of the output VG file.  For any given jet, the
VG file will include all maximum winds and all winds with flight
level deltas as barbs, and will alternate barbs and hash marks for
the remaining wind points.

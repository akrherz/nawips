Fixed marine zone St. Lawrence River in WBC products (SPC)

	Corrected a bug with the WBC text products listing the 
	St. Lawrence River as a state in SAW, SEL and the WOU initial.
	It is now treated as a marine zone and only appears in the 
	'COASTAL WATERS' marine zone listings in the WCL, WOU initial,
	and enhanced WSM.

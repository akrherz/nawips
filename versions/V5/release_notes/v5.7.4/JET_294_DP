Jet Element

	A. Added more control over the attributes of the jet element pieces

	All attributes of all jet element sub-elements - line, wind barbs and 
	text, and hash marks - may now be controlled by both the 'setting.tbl' 
	and 'uattribd.tbl'. Note that the jet barb and text always use the
	same color.

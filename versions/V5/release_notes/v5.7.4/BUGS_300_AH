BUGS

	A. Watch lock/resize marine zone and CW error (SPC)

	Fixed a bug reported by the SPC. With inclusion of marine zones 
	turned on, if a watch originally included a marine zone and then 
	was resized and the marine zone counties were deleted from the 
	watch, "CW" was included in the watch text products when it 
	should not have been.

	Also corrected, if ADD_MARZON in prefs.tbl is set to FALSE, 
	"CW" and Great Lake information was not being added to the 
	watch text files.

	B. NMAP2 seg. faulted with out marine zones on the SEV product

	Fixed a bug in which if marine zones did not exist, NMAP2 would
	crash when trying to create the SEV watch text product.

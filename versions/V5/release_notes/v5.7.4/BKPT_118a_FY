TASK: 12.1    TRACK: 118      EXT PROJ:  BKPT
Filter display of HRCN data by forecast hour

Added the ability to display HRCN output based on forecast valid time
instead of bulletin time in NMAP2 and GPMAP.  Seven new flags for each
of the forecasted positions have replaced the flag to plot all the
forecasted positions.  Based on the setting of the flag to plot the
forecasted hour, the corresponding wind/sea quadrant arc also will or
will not be plotted.  To set the flags in NMAP2, see the HRCN Attributes
window that pops up when the "Edit Source" button is clicked in NMAP2
for displaying MISC/HRCN data.  For instructions to use the new flags in
GPMAP, do a "help hrcn".

Since miscset.tbl was modified, old SPF files with HRCN data must
be recreated to use the new flags.

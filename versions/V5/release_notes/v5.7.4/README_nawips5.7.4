               N-AWIPS 5.7.4 Release Notes
                   	09/14/04 

Version 5.7.4 covers development from June 17, 2004 to September 13th.  

******************************************************************************

I.  Product Generation Changes
	
    A.	NMAP2 Product Generation Improvements 

	1. Added "All On"/Off" button to the Layer Control (ALL)

   	A new button, "All On"/All Off" has been added to toggle all layers
	on or off for display.   This button turns on/off all layer display
	check boxes.  Note that the active layer is always displayed 
        regardless of the status of its corresponding check box.

	2. Added Filter Control to Support GFA (AWC)

        A time filter mechanism has been added to PGEN.  This provides a 
        means to selectively display GFA, AIRMET, and non-convective SIGMET
        elements based upon their forecast time.
        
        The "Filter Control" GUI is started from the PGEN palette by clicking 
        the "Filter" button under the Actions (2nd group from the top).  The 
        "Filter Control" GUI displays all the specified times in the filter.tbl 
        (located in $GEMTBL/pgen/).

        The "Filter Control" GUI starts with no times selected.  If there are 
        any GFA elements drawn, they disappear when the filter control is  
        invoked.  The elements still exist, however they are not displayed.  
        The user can select one or more display times by checking one or more 
        check boxes.  As soon as a check box is turned on, all GFA AIRMETs 
        and SIGMETs which have a forecast hour that exactly matches one of the 
        selected times are displayed.  Please note this is an exact match.
        The "0" time matches the "0" forecast hour, while the "0-6" time (a 
        smear time) matches the forecast time of "0-6", and does not match "0",
        "3", or "6".

        The "Filter Control" GUI allows hot keys to enable the user to step 
        from one time to the next.  These are the "[" and "]" keys.  The "[" 
        key steps the control from right to left and the the "]" steps from
        left to right.  The "Filter Control" also includes an 
        "All On"/"All Off" button to simplify operation.

	3. Graphical Forecast for Aviation (GFA) GUI Enhancements (AWC)

	Linkages have been created between the GFA GUI, the "Layer Control",
	the "Filter Control" GUIs, and the data loop.  These linkages, which are
        described below, facilitate the access of GFA hazards and forecast 
        times.

	Each GFA hazard is accessed in a separate product generation layer.
	Hazard attributes are controlled by the GFA GUI and linked to the 
        product generation layer name.  Forecast times are accessed using the 
        "Filter Control" GUI and are linked to the "Forecast Hour" selections
	in the GFA GUI.

	    a)  GFA Type to Layer Control Linkage.  

	    When the GFA (or AIRMET/SIGMET) GUI starts, an effort is made to 
            match the current layer name to the hazard listed in the "Type" 
            pop up list.  If an exact match can be made between the layer 
            name and the "Type" pop up list, then that entry is automatically 
            selected in the GFA GUI.  

            If the user changes the "Type" pop up selection in the GFA GUI, 
            and if there is a matching layer by the same name, it 
            automatically becomes the active layer.  This means that if the 
            user changes the "Type" for a GFA from Turb to Ice, the layer 
            control changes the active layer to the layer named Ice (if there 
            is one).  The layer names can be set in an .lpf file or manually 
            edited.  The "Type" pop up entries are defined in the gfa.tbl, 
            airmet.tbl, and sigmet.tbl tables located in $GEMTBL/pgen.  Note 
            that the active layer and thus the GFA hazard can be quickly 
            selected using the number hot keys to switch the active layer. 
            (See item 5 below for details on the hot keys).
	
            b)  GFA/AIRMET/SIGMET Forecast Hour to Filter Control Linkage.  

            When the GFA (or AIRMET/SIGMET) GUI starts, an effort is made to 
            match the forecast hour with the first selected time in the "Filter 
            Control" GUI.  If an exact match of the first filter time string 
            with one of the forecast hour menu entries can be made, then that 
            menu entry is the selected forecast time in the GFA GUI.  Note 
            that an exact string match is required.  The 0-3, 3-6, and 0-6 
            filter times are for smears and do not match individual hour(s).

            If the user selects a new forecast hour in the GFA GUI, and that 
            time has not already been selected in the filter control, it is 
            turned on.  No other times are turned off, however.

	    A hazard number has been added to the GFA element.  This gives the
            user the means to link GFA elements depicting the same phenomena at
            different forecast times.  The linkage enables the auto select 
            for edit feature (described below).  It also allows the "smear all"
            capability that will be added in a future release.  The hazard 
            number is displayed in the GFA label on the first line at the 
            right.
 
            An automatic selection for edit capability has been added using the 
            hazard number.  It works in concert with the "Filter Control" GUI.  
            Assume there are GFAs with the same hazard number drawn at hours 0, 
            3, and 6.  Select the 0 time in the filter, and select the 0 hour 
            GFA element for editing.  The GFA GUI is started and allows the GFA 
            element to be edited.  Now, with the 0 hour element still selected, 
            step to hour 3 in the filter using the "]" hotkey.  The filter 
            turns off hour 0 and turns on hour 3.  The GFA element at hour 3 
            is automatically selected for editing.  Stepping once more with 
            the "]" key selects the 6 hour GFA element.

            c)  GFA/AIRMET/SIGMET GUI to Data Loop Linkage.	 

	    If GFA GUI is displayed for drawing new elements, and the user 
            steps to a different data loop, the GFA GUI is automatically 
            restarted.  Any GFA element that was only partially drawn is lost.  
            However, if all the points were drawn but the text was not yet 
            placed, the text is positioned in the center of the GFA.

 	4. Smear Improvements for GFA (AWC)

  	A small GUI has been added to the Smear action.  This GUI provides
	the means to control the color of the resulting new element
	generated by the smear.  Additional element attribute controls will be
	added in later releases.

	The new smeared element now has the worst case flight levels 
	(highest top and lowest bottom) of all the selected snapshot elements.
	For the GFA element the smear also includes the worst case description
	value.  Worst case is determined from the order listed in the 
        table $GEMTBL/pgen/gfa.tbl, where the order goes from least to 
        most "severe" conditions. 

        5.  Hot Keys Added to the Layer GUI (AWC, ALL)

	Hot keys have been added to control which layer is active.  Keys 
        1...0 switch the active layer to layers 1 - 10, respectively.  The 
        key combination of Shift and 1...0 change the active layer to layers 
        11 - 20, respectively.

  	6.  Interpolation Enhancements for GFA (AWC)

	Interpolation is now restricted to work only on GFA/AIRMET/SIGMET 
	elements of the same Area/Type.  Thus GFA/Turb elements can only be
	interpolated with other GFA/Turb elements.  

	The interpolation tool now provides linear interpolation of the flight 
	levels.  It also uses the worst case description value for GFA 
        elements.  Worst case is determined from the order listed in the 
        table $GEMTBL/pgen/gfa.tbl, where the order goes from least to 
        most "severe" conditions.

        7. Use SFC in GFA (AWC) 
  
	The string "SFC", meaning surface, is now available for use in the 
	bottom flight level of the GFA/AIRMET/SIGMET GUI.  The user can type in
	"SFC" or some portion thereof (case does not matter), and the "SFC" 
	is automatically completed (and converted to upper case).  SFC is
	assumed to be a value of 0 with regards to the interpolation and smear
	tools.

	8. Enhanced Symbol Labeling (HPC)

        Symbols now support text label attributes based on 
        $GEMPAK/pgen/grptyp.tbl entries.  This capability is similar to the 
        functionality that lines support.  When the user clicks the label 
        button in the symbol GUI to On, the label menu is made available.  
        The list of labels is taken from the grptyp.tbl.  Each label is now 
        linked to an attribute string (also in the grptyp.tbl) that can be 
        used to set default label attributes.  So for example, the first 
        label, say "1006", for a specific group can default to a color of 
        cyan and a font of Courier, while the next label, "1008", could 
        default to green and a font of Helvetica.

	9.  VAA (Volcanic Ash Advisory) Updates  (NESDIS, AR)

	The following enhancements were made at the request of NESDIS:

           a. Corrected the zero prefix in volcano longitude.
           b. Removed "OTHERS" choices from VAA ash cloud GUI.
           c. Allowed editing of the 6, 12 and 18 hour forecast information.  
              Users may now change the information presented in the "Observed 
              and Forecast Ash Cloud Information..." popup labeled 
              "VAA Ash Cloud Info".  These changes are reflected in the final 
              text product.

	10. Added Checks on Watch Format GUI entries (SPC)

	The following checks were added to the Watch Format GUI to 
	improve quality control:
	
            a. Check the current watch number against the list of watch
               replacement numbers.  If the current watch number is in
               the replacement watch number list, a warning message
               appears.
            b. Check whether the current number has already been used. If
               it has been used, the user is prompted to overwrite the files.
            c. Check that the WSM check box for reference mesoscale
               discussion is toggled off when the GUI pops up.

	11. Updated the Enhanced WSM and Status Message Display (SPC)

        A line containing the watch type and watch number 
        ("STATUS REPORT FOR W? ####") has been added to the enhanced watch 
        status message.  This line can be optionally added by setting the 
        variable ADD_WSM_WS_WT to TRUE in the table, $GEMTBL/config/prefs.tbl.

        Also, the old WSM text has been replaced with the enhanced WSM text 
        in the "Watch Status Save" GUI.  Both WSM text files are still 
        saved to the local directory.

	12. NMAP Breakpoint GUI and Text Product Enhancements (TPC)

    	Breakpoint selection for non-special geographies (meaning standard
    	breakpoint pairs, not islands and water) can now be either from the 
    	official breakpoints or from official and supplemental points.  The 
    	"Breakpoint Type" menu is used to make this selection.  By selecting 
    	"Official" only the official breakpoints can be selected.  By selecting 
    	"All" the user can choose from both official and supplemental 
        breakpoints.
    
        Special geographies are now functional.  These include islands and 
        bodies of water.  In order to use either of these categories, 
        click on the TCA icon on the palette to start the TCA window.  
        Select "Islands" or "Water" in the Special Geography menu.  Now 
        click on New Segment.  The displayed breakpoints correspond to 
        the selected geography.  Use the left mouse button to select points 
        for the segment.  The left mouse button selects both new points and 
        switches off those points that are already selected (toggle action).  
        To complete the segment, click on the middle mouse button.  The segment 
        is displayed in the TCA window as either ISLANDS_# or WATER_#.  The # 
        is just a sequentially assigned number.  It has no other meaning.  The
        # is used to identify the group of points, since the special 
        geography segment may contain more than two breakpoints.
    
    	Multiple selection of special geography points is also available.  
        After clicking on New Segment, click and hold mouse button 1 down.  
        Now drag the mouse and a temporary box is displayed.  All 
        breakpoints within the box are selected when the left mouse 
        button is released.  An alternate method is to use the shift button 
        and the left mouse click at the same time.  This action creates a 
        temporary closed figure.  Click with the left mouse button to define 
        its points.  When finished, click the middle mouse button 
        and all breakpoints within the defined figure are selected.  If 
        unwanted points are inadvertently selected they may be de-selected 
        using single clicks of the left mouse button.  

	The breakpoint text message may now be created using the TCA element in
    	PGEN.  After a TCA has been created, select it and click on the "Create
    	Text" button.  The text message is created and displayed.  The message 
    	is saved into a local file (the file name is displayed below the text 
    	message).  Click the "Cancel" button and the text is not saved.

	Note that the text message expects to find a VG file containing the 
        previous TCA element (earlier advisory number) for the storm.  If 
        that file is not present in the local directory, then the text message 
        is created as if the storm is new.  Also note that in this release
	the text message can only be generated with U.S. Mainland breakpoints.
	Other breakpoint processing will be added in future releases.

	Also, corrected a problem where selection of breakpoint segments
	was not working properly when roaming.
  
	*** Important Please Note ***

        Please note that in this release the internal structure of the TCA was 
        modified.  As a result, TCAs in 5.7.4 are incompatible with all 
        previous releases.  VG files from earlier NMAP2 versions should not 
        be used.  The NMAP breakpoint GUI is for TPC testing and evaluation
	purposes only, in preparation for the 2005 Hurricane season.

    B.  Product Generation Pre/Post-Processing Programs

	1. SIGMET output file location (AR, AWC)

	A new option, SIG_FILE_DIR, has been added to the preferences table, 
        $GEMTBL/config/prefs.tbl, that specifies the location of the 
        directory where the SIGMET text product are saved.

	2. Implement Time Filter in GPMAP for GFA (AWC)

        The VGFILE parameter now includes a filter parameter.  The filter 
        parameter can be used to selectively display the GFA/AIRMET/SIGMET 
        elements in a VG file based upon element forecast time.  

        The filter string is a series of times separated by ";".  So a filter 
        string of "0;3;6" would display only GFA elements that have a forecast 
        time of 0, 3, or 6.  Note that this time match must be exact -- "0-6" 
        would display a smeared GFA but not the snapshot GFAs at 0, 3, and 6.  

        Elements that do not have a forecast time (meaning all elements 
        except for the GFA, AIRMET, and non-convective SIGMET) are unaffected
        by the filter.  They are always displayed.  

	3. Rename FROM line text file for AIRMETS (AWC)  

        The From Line for the new AIRMETs (class MET, not class SIGMET) has
        been changed.  The From Line is now saved into a file with this naming
        convention:

                ZULU_#.frm      (for icing areas)
                TANGO_#.frm     (for turbulence areas)
                SIERRA_#.frm    (for all other AIRMET area types)

        The # is the AIRMET's sequence number.

	4.  Changed Hash Mark Speed and Flight Level Assignment for Jets (AWC)

	Program VG2UKA, which converts high-level SigWx data from a VG file 
        to the UKMET ASCII format, has been modified to conform to 
        revised specifications for the assignment of wind speed and flight 
        level values to hash marks.

	The way in which wind speeds are defined for hash marks has been 
        changed in the WAFC (World Area Forecast Center) documentation.
	The hash mark wind speeds are now "maximum speed relative as opposed 
        to minimum wind (80 KT) relative."  Ideally, each hash mark represents 
        a 20 knot change (decrease) moving away from the nearest maximum wind 
        speed defined for a barb.  Error handling for miscoded hash marks is 
        now done in accordance with specifications received from the AWC.  
        The WAFC documentation also indicates that each hash mark is assigned a 
        flight level.  The flight level is equal to the level assigned to 
        the nearest wind barb.

	5.  Converted New Jet Element from ASCII to VGF (AWC)

	Program SIGAVGF, which converts SIGWX data from the UKMET browsable
	ASCII format to a VG file, now creates jet elements instead of
	grouped jets.  This means that flight level deltas can now be
	included as part of the output VG file.  For any given jet, the
	VG file includes all maximum winds and all winds with flight
	level deltas as barbs, and alternates barbs and hash marks for
	the remaining wind points.

	6.  Added More Control for Jet Element Attributes (AWC)

	Jet element attribute settings for line, wind barbs, text and 
	hash marks may now be specified in $GEMTBL/pgen/setting.tbl and
	$GEMTBL/pgen/uattribd.tbl, for NMAP display and post-processing,
	respectively.  Note that "TEXT TYPE" has been added to these tables.
	Also note that the barb and text always use the same color.
	
	7.  Added 'TEST' Wording to the WOU Update Text Product (SPC)

	Added logic so that if a test watch is issued, the WOU update text
        product has the following string in the MND line:
 
               "TEST...TORNADO WATCH OUTLINE UPDATE FOR WT 138...TEST"

        Also, the product code in the VTEC line is changed from the 
        current setting in $GEMTBL/txtprd/woudef.tbl to the character 'T'.

        If the watch is not a test watch, then the MND line has the following
	string:

               "EXPERIMENTAL...TORNADO WATCH OUTLINE UPDATE FOR WT 138"

        and the product code for the VTEC is obtained from the woudef.tbl
        table as in previous versions of the program.

	8.  Final WOU Update State Zone String and VTEC Change (SPC)

	The State Zone and VTEC strings were placed above the No Active
	County and Marine Zone strings.  This change was done at the
	request of the SPC to make the Final WOU consistent with the
	initial WOU.

	9.  Experimental Hurricane Graphics Program (TPC)

	Program GPTCWW, introduced in release 5.7.3, has been improved to
	allow the plotting of watches and warnings for the smaller
	Caribbean islands and for certain small bodies of water (sounds,
	bays and lakes).  It also allows supplemental breakpoints
	(non-official breakpoints which appear in the breakpoint table) to
	be plotted as the endpoint(s) of a watch or warning segment.

	Please note:  GPTCWW is for test and evaluation purposes only.
	GPKGRF continues to be the operational program for creating the
	watch/warning graphic.

II.  NMAP2 Display Improvements 

    A.  Filter display of HRCN data by forecast hour (OPC, ALL)

	Added the ability to display HRCN output based on forecast valid time
	instead of bulletin time in NMAP2 and GPMAP.  Seven new flags for each
	of the forecast positions have replaced the flag to plot all the
	forecast positions in the table $GEMTBL/config/miscset.tbl.  See this
	table for additional details.  Based on the setting of the flag, 
	the corresponding wind/sea quadrant arc is plotted.  To set the 
        flags in NMAP2, see the HRCN Attributes window that pops up when 
        the "Edit Source" button is clicked in NMAP2.  For instructions to 
        use the new flags in GPMAP, type "help hrcn".

	**** Important Please Note ****

	Since miscset.tbl was modified, old SPF files with HRCN data must 
        be recreated to use the new flags.

    B.	Added Plotting of Ambiguity QuikScat Data (TPC, OPC)

	NMAP2 and GPMAP have been enhanced to allow plotting of the four 
        QuikScat ambiguity files.  Each ambiguity file is treated as a 
        separate miscellaneous data type:  AMBG1, AMBG2, AMBG3, and AMBG4.  
        Each ambiguity is defaulted to a different color in NMAP2 to allow
	the ambiguities to be distinguished if they are displayed together. 
        Select each file using the the "MISC" data category in the NMAP 
        "Data Selection Window".  Desired attribute settings can be saved to 
        SPFs and easily restored for future displays. 

	The table $GEMTBL/config/miscset.tbl has been modified to include
	default attribute settings for each ambiguity data type.  See
	this table for additional information.  Also, the table
	$GEMTBL/config/datatype.tbl has been modified to add entries
	for each ambiguity data type.  See this table for additional
	details.

III. Decoder Improvements

    A.  AIRMET Valid Time Decoding (AWC)

	The AIRMET decoder DCAIRM has been modified to provide three times 
        instead of two: the issue time, actual beginning valid time, and 
        actual ending valid time.  See dcairm.hlp for the new format of the 
        decoded file.  

	NMAP2 and GPMAP have been modified to process the new decoded AIRMET 
        files as well as files in the old format.  A new flag has been added 
        to allow the user to select whether to plot AIRMETs based on the 
        issue time or the beginning valid time.  Type "help airm" in GPMAP 
        for instructions on using the new flag.  To use the flag in NMAP2 
        see the AIRM Attributes window that pops up when the "Edit Source" 
        button is clicked in the "Data Selection Window" of NMAP2 for 
        MISC/AIRM data.  

	The flag "Using Issue Time" has been added to the AIRM section of the 
        table $GEMTBL/config/miscset.tbl to specify whether the issue time
	is used for NMAP AIRMET plotting.  Set the flag to 1, to use 
	the issue time.

	***** Important Please Note ****

	Since miscset.tbl was modified, old SPF files using AIRMET data should 
        be recreated.

IV.  General Improvements

    A.  GD programs use the CPF file points (ALL)

	GD programs have been enhanced to use lat/lon points from NMAP 
        cursor point files (CPFs).  The CPF name has been added to the GEMPAK 
        parameters GPOINT and CXSTNS for use by the GD programs gdcross, 
        gdprof, gdthgt, and gdtser.  This feature allows the exact latitude 
        and longitude of a point specified within the NMAP seek function to 
        be used by these programs.  The CPF is created by clicking the 
        "Save CPF" button from within seek.

	For more information, view the help files for GPOINT and CXSTNS at 
        $GEMHLP/hlx/<name>.hl2 or enter help on these parameters when 
        running GEMPAK programs.  

	**** Important Please Note ****

	Each CPF must be saved with the correct number of lat/lon pairs,
	i.e., one or two in order for the GD programs to properly execute.
	For example, a CPF must contain two lat/lon pairs, for a program
	that requires two points, e.g., gdcross; and one pair for a program
	that requires one lat/lon pair, e.g., gdprof.

    B.	Added Vector Information to Graph-to-Grid Info File (ALL)

        Wind barb and vector information (speed, direction, location, etc.) has 
        been added to the information file, '*.info'.  This information is in 
        preparation for later development of generating U and V grids from 
        randomly placed wind barbs/vectors.  The vector information should 
        not impact the current graph-to-grid performance or capabilities.

    C.  Added Meteorological Impact Statements to NWX (AWC)
	
	Added Meteorological Impact Statements to NWX.  Click on 
	"Met Impact Statements" under the "Aviation Forecasts" data category 
	to display these messages.

	These statements are located in $TEXT_DATA/aviation/mis/ in the
	text data base.  The LDM pqact.conf and scour.conf have been 
	modified to parse and delete these data, respectively.  In addition,
        a new NWX table, $GEMTBL/nwx/mis.bull has been added to allow NWX to 
        display the statements and the table, $GEMTBL/nwx/master.tbl has
	been updated, accordingly.

    D.  Increased Maximum Grid Access Size on AIX (NCO)

	The maximum number of grid points that GEMPAK can access has been
	increased to 750,000 to match the other platforms.  This limit
	had been less on AIX because of AIX4 workstation limitations.  AIX5
	does not pose this limitation and AIX4 is no longer supported.

    E.	Increased Maximum Number of Reports for NWX (SPC)

	The maximum number of reports that can be displayed in NWX was 
        increased from 300 to 1000 at the request of the SPC.

V.  Bug Corrections 

    A.  Corrected NWX Iconification Problem (ALL)

	NWX can now be iconified.  In version 5.7.3, this capability was
	inadvertently removed.

    B.  Corrected GIF Image Generation Problem (AWC)

	A problem where the GIF driver did not create output for image
	data was corrected. 

    C.  Corrected Marine Zone Centroids for WBC (SPC)

	Fixed a problem where some centroids were not located in the
        correct county or marine zone. Added checks when creating the
        maps and bounds files to check if the centroid is properly
        located.

    D.  Fixed Handling of St. Lawrence River in WBC Products (SPC)

	Corrected a bug with the WBC text products where the St. Lawrence 
        River was listed as a state in SAW, SEL and the WOU initial.  It is 
        now treated as a marine zone and only appears in the 'COASTAL WATERS' 
        marine zone listings in the WCL, WOU initial, and enhanced WSM.

    E.  Watch lock/resize marine zone and CW error (SPC)

	Corrected a problem where the string "CW" was erroneously included
	in watch products if the watch originally included marine zones and 
        then was resized not to include marine zones.

        Also corrected the problem where if ADD_MARZON was set to FALSE in 
        the prefs.tbl, "CW" and Great Lake information was not properly added 
        to the watch text files.

    F.  NMAP Print Problem (TPC, ALL)

	Corrected a problem where NMAP would not print out data that included
	images.

    G.  NMAP Lat/Lon Display Problem (TPC)

	Corrected the problem where latitude-longitude lines were not being  
        plotted correctly on unremapped satellite imagery.

VI. Known Bugs  

    A.  Default Button In Custom Map Definition GUI (ALL)

        The "DEF Content" button in the "Custom Map Definition" GUI
        does not work.  It is supposed to list the default map
        projection for selected geographic regions.

VII. Map and Table File Updates

    The following summarizes significant table changes.  See 
    $NAWIPS/versions/tables.log and nawips.log for a complete list of all 
    table and map file changes. 

    A.  Updated Regional Temp and Precip Table for NWX (ALL)

        Updated the regional temperature/precipitation table, rgtmpc.stn,
        to include new and modified stations and to add the state IDs.
        This table is located in $GEMTBL/nwx.

    B.  Updated the Marine Zones Map and Table Files (ALL) 

	Updated the marine zones map and table files in accordance with 
        SCN 04-31 and with SCN 04-17.  The Marine Zones in WFO HFO 
        (Honolulu, HI) have been reconfigured.  Also, the wording of ANZ070 in 
        CAR was modified and marine zone AMZ435 in WFO JAX was removed.

    C.  Added Map and Bounds Files for Six AIRMET Regions (AWC)

	Map and bounds files have been added for the six AIRMET regions.
	The map file is $GEMMAPS/airmet.ncp and the bounds file is
	$GEMTBL/bounds/airmet_bnds.tbl.

    D.  Added Marianas Islands to Volcano Tabe (AWC)

        The Marianas Islands were added to the volcano table, 
        $GEMTBL/stns/volcano.tbl at the request of the AWC.

    E.	Added Svrwx.bull to NWX Tables (HPC, ALL)

        Added the severe weather summary table, svrwx.bull, to NWX directory
        of tables.  It is located in $GEMTBL/nwx.

    E.  Corrected Entries in Synoptic Station Tale for NWX (HPC, ALL)

	Several entries in the synoptic station table, $GEMTBL/stns/lsfstns.tbl
	were corrected to allow NWX access.  NWX should now be able to access
	all stations listed in the table.  Station IDs and state codes were 
        added if they were missing.  These changes do not affect the synoptic 
        data decoder.	

    F.  Added 1000 Fathom Map File (OPC)

	A map file depicting the 1000 fathom contour off the East Coast of the
	United States and southern Canada has been added.  This file is
	$GEMMAPS/hikfwa.ncp.  The alias, "1000fthm" has been added to the
	table $GEMTBL/config/mapfil.tbl to reference the map.  The map appears 
        as "1000_Fathom" in the NMAP "Overlays" scroll list.

    G.  Updated station tables (SPC, ALL)

        Updated the surface station table, sfstns.tbl, for the SPC by adding 
        78 new stations and removing 25 inactive stations.  Also updated the
        xrainsort.tbl with 35 new stations and change the ID for 8 stations.

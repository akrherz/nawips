Task Title:    13.1  Allow plotting of ambiguity data as new data type
Track Number:  249

NMAP2 and GPMAP have been enhanced to allow plotting of the four QuikScat
ambiguity files.  Each ambiguity file is treated as a separate miscellaneous
data type:  AMBG1, AMBG2, AMBG3, and AMBG4.  Each ambiguity has been defaulted
to a different color in NMAP2, so that each can be selected one at a time
using the New Source button (MISC) in the Data Selection Window and be
displayed together.  After this is done initially and desired attribute
settings have been selected, these data settings can be saved to an SPF file
and be easily restored for future displays.

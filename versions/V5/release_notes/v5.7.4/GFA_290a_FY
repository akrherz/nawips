AIRMET valid time decoding

The AIRMET decoder DCAIRM has been modified to provide three times instead of
two: the issue time, actual beginning valid time, and actual ending valid time.
See dcairm.hlp for the new format of the decoded file.  NMAP2 and GPMAP have
been modified to process the new decoded AIRMET files as well as files in the
old format.  A new flag has been added to allow the user to select whether to
plot based on the issue time or the beginning valid time.  Do a "help airm" in
GPMAP for instructions on using the new flag.  To use the flag in NMAP2 see the
AIRM Attributes window that pops up when the Edit Source button is clicked in
the Data Selection Window of NMAP2 for MISC/AIRM data.

Since miscset.tbl was modified, old SPF files using AIRMET data should be
recreated.

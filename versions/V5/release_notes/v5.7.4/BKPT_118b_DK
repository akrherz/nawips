Experimental Hurricane Graphics Program (TPC)

Program GPTCWW, introduced in release 5.7.3, has been improved to
allow the plotting of watches and warnings for the smaller
Caribbean islands and for certain small bodies of water (sounds,
bays and lakes).  It also allows supplemental breakpoints
(non-official breakpoints which appear in the breakpoint table) to
be plotted as the endpoint(s) of a watch or warning segment.

Please note:  GPTCWW is for test and evaluation purposes only.
GPKGRF continues to be the operational program for creating the
watch/warning graphic.

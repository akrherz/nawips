Product Generations Changes

Add "All On" and "All Off" buttons to the Layer Control.


   These buttons are shortcut mechanisms to turn the checkboxes for all the 
   layers in the layer control window either on or off.  Each layer checkbox 
   controls whether or not vg elements on the corresponding layer are displayed 
   when that layer is not the active layer.  (The active layer selection is 
   indicated by the layer name button with the black background and white text).
   Note that the current layer is always displayed regardless of the status of 
   it's corresponding check box.


Fixed symbol labeling from grptyp.tbl. (HPC)

   Symbols now support text label attributes based on grptyp.tbl entries.  This
   is similar to the functionality that lines support.  When the user clicks 
   the label button in the symbol GUI to On, the label menu is made available.  
   The list of labels is taken from the grptyp.tbl.  Each label is now linked to
   an attribute string (also in the grptyp.tbl) which can be used to set 
   default label attributes.  So for example, the first label, say "1006", 
   for a specific group can default to a color of cyan and a font of Courier, 
   while the next label, "1008", could default to green and a font of Helvetica.


Use number keys as hotkeys for switching layers.

   Added hotkeys to control layer switching from the keyboard.  Keys 1..0 
   switch the active layer to layers 1 - 10.  The key combination of Shift and 
   1..0 change the active layer to layers 11 - 20.

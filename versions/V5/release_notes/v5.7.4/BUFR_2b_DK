Changed Hash Mark Speed and Flight Level Assignment for Jets (AWC)

Program VG2UKA, which converts high-level SigWx data from a VG
file to the UKMET browsable ASCII format, has been modified to
conform to revised specifications for the assignment of wind speed
and flight level values to hash marks.

The way in which wind speeds are defined for hash marks has been
changed in the WAFC (World Area Forecast Center) documentation.
The hash mark wind speeds will now be "maximum speed relative as
opposed to minimum wind (80 KT) relative."  Ideally, each hash mark
will represent a 20 knot change (decrease) moving away from the
nearest maximum wind speed defined for a barb.  Error handling for
miscoded hash marks is now done in accordance with specifications
received from the AWC.  The WAFC documentation also says that each
hash mark will be assigned a flight level.  The flight level will
be equal to that of the nearest wind barb.

Watch-By-County

	D. Added 'TEST' wording to the WOU update text product (SPC)

	Added logic so that if a test watch is issued, the WOU update text
	product will read in the MND line, 
	       "TORNADO WATCH OUTLINE UPDATE FOR WT 138...TEST"
	Also, the product code in the VTEC line will be changed from the 
	current setting in $GEMTBL/txtprd/woudef.tbl to the character 'T'.
	If the watch is not a test watch, then the MND line will read,
	       "EXPERIMENTAL...TORNADO WATCH OUTLINE UPDATE FOR WT 138"
	and the product code that will be used is the one set in the table.

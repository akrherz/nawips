Patch 5.6.l.1 covers bug fixes from June 23, 2003 to July 11, 2003.  

******************************************************************************

I.  Bug Corrections 

    A.  QuikScat Data Plotting in NMAP2 on Linux (OPC)

	Fixed problem reported by the OPC where NMAP2 would crash when
	plotting the QuikScat data with a skip value larger than zero.
	The problem was that the time stamp was being processed even if 
	the data was not swapped properly for Linux.

    B.  Grid Data Does Not Load Properly (ALL)

	Fixed a problem first reported by the OPC, then encountered by all
	of the centers. The problem occurs when plotting GFS model data
	immediately after plotting data from a grid that has a different
	navigation. The internal grid navigation was not being set to the GFS
	navigation.

	This problem was seen in NMAP2 and all of the GD grid plotting programs.

    C.	NWX Print Problem (ALL)

	Fixed a problem with printing text data from NWX. NWX will again print
	any requested data.

    D.  NMAP2 Crashes When ATCF Data is in an SPF File (ALL)

	This bug was fixed and the ATCF data can be included in a Saved
	Procedure File for NMAP2.

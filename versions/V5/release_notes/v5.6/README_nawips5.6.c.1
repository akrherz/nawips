			N-AWIPS 5.6.c.1 Release Notes
				4/3/01	


Patch 5.6.c.1 corrects the following problems in product generation found in 
version 5.6.c  

	1. Corrected the problem where front and symbol size and widths could
	   not be edited.

	2. Corrected the problem where the excessive rainfall product was 
	   not generated properly when the label was enabled.

	3. Corrected the problem where objects were improperly assigned group 
	   numbers when saved to the VG file.

The outlook generation software was modified to distinguish between filled 
and unfilled lines with no text label.  Filled lines generate 
"SIGNIFICANT SEVERE" and unfilled lines generate "GENERAL THUNDERSTORMS" in 
the outlook text products.  This modification was done at the request of the 
SPC.

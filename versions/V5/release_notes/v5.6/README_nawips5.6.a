Patch 5.6.a covers development from August 25 to November 2, 2000.  

PLEASE NOTE:  Version 5.5.d was released by Unidata to the university
community as version 5.6.  Therefore, we have designated version 5.5.d 
as version 5.6.  This patch is thus 5.6.a

PLEASE NOTE:  These release notes summarize the new functionality, 
enhancements, and bug corrections made for this patch.  The complete
set of changes with additional details are documented in the following
NAWIPS logs in $NAWIPS/versions:

	changes.log
	tables.log

********************************************************************

I. Product Generation Changes

    A.	NMAP Product Generation Improvements

	1. Track Function Improvements (SPC, AWC)

	   Several improvements were made to the track function.  The user
	   can now select or enter the time interval.  A pop-up allows
	   the selection of pre-defined intervals which are read from the
	   table: $GEMTBL/config/trkint.tbl.  Alternatively, the value can
	   be entered in the text box.  Label attributes can now be specified
	   by clicking on the down arrow that appears in the lower right
	   corner of the GUI.  Clicking this arrow pops up a pane which
	   allows the user to select label skip factor, font, size and 
	   style.

	2. Tropical and Volcanic Ash Sigmets (AWC)

	   Added the capability to generate tropical and volcanic ash 
	   international SIGMETS.  The international SIGMET GUI and 
	   message production have been enhanced to generate these
	   SIGMET types.

	3. Watch Generation Improvements (SPC)

	   Anchor points are now saved as part of the VGF associated with the
	   watch.  This corrects the problem that occurred where in some
	   cases the anchor points associated with a watch were incorrect.
	   The watch area is now calculated in square nautical miles instead
	   of square statute miles at the request of the SPC.

	   Watch counties are now cleared each time the watch is altered, moved
	   or copied.  Previously, the original counties associated with the 
	   watch were not cleared out until the create counties or clear counties
	   button was clicked.

	4. Modify Function Improvements (HPC)

	   The modify function was rewritten to correct several problems that
	   have been observed.  The ghosting now always matches the modify action
	   which follows a well-defined set of rules.  The modify function 
	   applies to both open and closed lines and may either 

	   1) replace an interior portion of a line (both first and last clicks
	      are on the original line),
	   2) replace a portion of a line starting somewhere in the middle and 
	      continuing to (and replacing) the end (only first click on 
	      original line), or
	   3) totally replace the line with a new line having the same 
	      attributes as the original line (first click off the original line).  

	   In the cases where the first mouse click is on the line, the direction
	   of modification is controlled by the location of the second clicked
	   point relative to the first clicked point.

    B.	NMAP Product Generation Bug Corrections    

	1. Label Function (HPC)

	   The label action was corrected so that text is properly grouped
           with its associated object.

	2. Watch County List Fatal Error

	   NMAP/NMAP2 no longer crashes if any button in the "Watch 
	   Specifications and County List" GUI is clicked BEFORE a watch is 
	   drawn.

II. NMAP Display Improvements	

    A.	New AVN MOS and MRF MOS Display (ALL)
    
       	Added the capability to display the new AVN MOS and MRF MOS in NMAP and
       	NMAP2. 

    B. 	AWIPS Satellite Data (RFC, AR, PR)

       	NMAP can now display AWIPS satellite images.  Note that the environment
	variable SAT should be set to /data/fxa/sat/SBN/netCDF to properly access 
	the top of the satellite directories on AWIPS.  Also note that the netCDF 
	libraries and source have been added to the directory tree that are needed 
	to access the satellite data.  They are located at: $GEMPAK/netcdf-3.4


III. NMAP Bug Corrections

    A.  Bad Radar Image Fatal Error (SPC)
	
	NMAP, NMAP2 and GPMAP will no longer produce a fatal error when 
	displaying a incorrectly encoded NIDS image.  Instead, the
	bad image will not be displayed.

    B.	Bad Frame Auto-Update Problem (TPC)

	NMAP did not properly auto-update if the last frame was set to
	a bad frame in a loop sequence.  This problem was corrected.


IV. Decoder Improvements

    A.  New MOS Decoders (ALL)

	Two new decoders, DCMOSA and DCMOSM, were written to decode the
	new AVN MOS and new MRF MOS, respectively.

    B.  Correction to Watch Decoder (SPC)

	The maximum number of points allowed in a status line was 
	increased from 8 to 50 to handle multiple status lines in
	a watch.

    C.  International SIGMET Decoder (AWC)

	The international SIGMET decoder was modified to properly handle
	the decoding of a thunderstorm included as a part of a tropical
	cylone report.

    D.  Non-convective SIGMET Decoder (AWC)

	The non-convective SIGMET decoder was modified to handle additional
	phenomena abbreviations.


V. General Improvements

    A. 	TIFF Driver Enhancements (MPC) 

       	The ability to output satellite images was added to the TIFF
	device driver.  The output uses 16 grey shades for images.
	To write an image to a TIFF file, specify the parameter DEVICE to:
	tiff|prod_name||g, where g flag sets the device to use the grey
	shades.  See the on-line help on DEVICE for additional details.

    B.  GDGRIB Improvements (HPC)

	The GDGRIB program was modified to allow a constant grid
	with missing values.  Also, removed redundant success 
	messages.

    C.	AWIPS Redbook Graphics Driver (HPC)

	The base date/time parameter was modified for the RBK driver
	to allow the use of the full GEMPAK date/time string.  Any
	missing parts of the string are supplied by the current system
	time.

    D.	Updated Mid-Atlantic River Basin Map (RFC)

	The Mid-Atlantic river basin map was updated using the latest
	shape file from NWS.

    E.	Graph-to-Grid (HPC, RFC)

	Modified program GRPHGD to output a grid of default values if
	there are no contour values.

    F.  NTRANS (SPC)

	Increased the maximum number of metafiles allowed in a directory
	from 100 to 200 files. 

    G.  Contour Clipping for VG Files (MPC, HPC)

	Added the ability to clip contours drawn to a VG output file.  The
	clipping is performed on contours that are outside of the defined
	graphics area (GAREA).  Contour clipping corrects the problem 
	reported by the MPC where unnecessary contours were drawn when
	the graphics area crossed the grid break for CED grids, e.g., the
	AVN and MRF models.


VI. General Bug Corrections

    A.	GIF Driver Background Color (AWC)

	Corrected the GIF driver problem where the background color was
	improperly set for satellite images.

    B.  AWIPS Redbook Graphics Display (ALL)

	The display of AWIPS Redbook graphics files has been corrected
	to properly display model products that could not be displayed
	in previous versions.

    C.	Hash Mark Attribute Problems in VG Driver (AWC)

	Corrected a problem where the hash mark line width and spacing
	were not consistent when saving a VG file to an output VG file.

    D.  Rectilinear Projection Problem (AWC)

	Corrected a navigation error for the display of McIDAS images
	in the RECT projection.

    E.  GDPLOT2 Fatal Error (HPC)

	Corrected fatal error in GDPLOT2 if the GAREA parameter is set
	to be blank.

    F.  SFCHCK String Length Problem (Unidata)

	Modified SFCHCK to handle 20 minute data by increasing the size
	of array strings from 132 to 512 characters.


VII. Known Problems

    A.  Add/Delete Counties 

	If counties are added or deleted, these counties are not saved 
	correctly to the product text files if either the "Apply" button
	is clicked on the "FORMAT WATCH" GUI, or the watch is saved and
	issued later in a session.

    B.	NMAP Clear Zoomed Image Problem

	Clearing a zoomed image clears the data but does not properly
	reset the map to the default area and projection.  In this case
	the user must click on the map window to get a proper map area 
	and projection.  This problem does not occur in NMAP2. 

    C.	NMAP2 Set Time Problem for Observational Data Older Than 2 Days

 	NMAP2 does not load data older than 2 days for observational data
	types, e.g., METAR data.

VIII. Calling Sequence Changes

    A.	$GEMPAK/source/cgemlib/cvg/cvgsigsto.c, cvgsvsig.c, cvgsvtrk.c, cvgtrksto.c
    B.	$GEMPAK/source/gemlib/gg/ggmisc.f
    C.	$GEMPAK/source/programs/gp/gpmap/gpminp.f
    D.	$GEMPAK/source/cgemlib/clo/clodddec.c
    E.	$GEMPAK/source/bridge/is/istc.f
    F.	$GEMPAK/source/driver/active/tiff/tinita.c
    G.	$GEMPAK/source/bridge/af/afobdh.f, afrtim.f, afxbif.f
    H.	$GEMPAK/source/gemlib/cv/cvmdfy.c


See the nawips.log and changes.log for additional details concerning
these routines.


IX.  Device Driver Name Change

	IMPORTANT PLEASE NOTE:

       	The GIF driver that does not use X windows has been renamed from
       	GIF2 to GIF.

X.  Table Format Changes

	IMPORTANT PLEASE NOTE:

	The format of $GEMTBL/nmap/mapovl.nmap has changed with the addition
	of the DEFAULT column.  This change was done in preparation for 
	having the capability to turn on/off overlays by default which will be
	added in a future patch.  The software can read the either the new or 
	old format.

XI.  NMAP2: Evaluation Version:

**** NOTE THAT NMAP2 SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CREATE OPERATIONAL PRODUCTS. ****  

NMAP2 continues to be made available to obtain user feedback.  Many 
bug corrections and improvements have been made in response to user 
feedback and CDB testing.

    A. NMAP functions NOT implemented in NMAP2

	1. The "stop" function is not implemented.

	2. Default data set selections for specific types, e.g, satellite
	   data are not implemented in NMAP2.

    B. NMAP2 Bug Corrections

	1. Fatal Error With Large Number of Files (SPC) 

	   NMAP2 can now access directories with up to 1000 files.
	   Previously, the maximum number was set to 200.  Also, previously
	   if the directory contained more than 200 files, NMAP2 crashed.  Now,
	   if there are more than 1000 files in the directory, NMAP2 will
	   only access the most recent 1000 files.

	2. Fatal Error with Roam (ALL)

	   If non-consecutive roam values were entered in the roam table,
	   ($GEMTBL/nmap/nmap_roam.tbl), NMAP2 would crash after roaming
	   frames and popping up the data window.  This problem has been
	   corrected. 

    C. 	NMAP2 Improvements

	1.  Display of Non-Convective SIGMETS (AWC)

	    Added the capability to display non-convective sigmets in NMAP2 
	    as a miscellaneous data type.  GPMAP can now also display 
	    non-convective SIGMETS.

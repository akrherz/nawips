			N-AWIPS 5.6.e.1 Release Notes
				November 1, 2001	

Patch 5.6.e.1 includes corrections to NMAP2 and modifications to handle 
upcoming product format changes at the AWC and SPC.   In addition,
file handling problems with some of the grid programs have been corrected.
A few other bug corrections and improvements are also included.

Patch 5.6.e.1 covers development from September 26 to November 1, 2001.  

I.  NMAP2 Corrections

    A.	Problems with Directories with Greater Than 87 Files (SPC, AWC)	
	
	Corrected the problem where information in the "Data Selection
	Window" GUI was being corrupted when accessing data with greater
	than 87 data files in a directory.  Also, corrected the problem
	where SPF files were corrupted. 

    B.  SPF Problem with Environment Variables (AWC)

	Corrected the problem where satellite images could not be restored
	if the environment variable used to define the top of the satellite
	directory was not named "SAT".

II. Product Generation Changes and Corrections

    A.  Modify Extra Point Problem (AWC, MPC)

	Corrected the problem where modifying near a line vertex added an
	extra point.

    B.  International Sigmet ICAO Format Change (AWC, AR)

	Added the capability to decode International Sigmets complying
	with the upcoming ICAO format change for the lat/long string.
	The decoder can handle either the hemisphere indicator after the
	lat/lon string (current format) or the hemisphere indicator before
	the lat/lon string (future format). 

	Also added the option in NMAP/NMAP2 product generation to create
	International Sigmets with either format.  Two radio buttons have
	been added to the "International SIGMET Edit" GUI.  Click the
	"new" button to format using the new ICAO format.  Click the "old"
	button to format using the current format.  Currently the GUI 
	defaults to "old", the current format.

III.  SPC Product Header Changes for November 7th (ALL)

      The watch decoder, DCWTCH, has been modified to handle the new header
      format for SPC watch and watch status products.  The LDM pqact.conf file
      has also been modified to account for the new format.  In addition, watch
      products generated by NMAP/NMAP2 have been modified to output the
      new header format.  Also, the "#" character has been removed from
      the watch number at the request of the SPC.

IV.  GRID Program File Handling Corrections (ALL) 

      The grid programs, GDDIAG, GDSTAT, GDPLOT, GDTHGT, GDTSER, have been 
      corrected to properly handle cases where the same grid file is re-opened 
      multiple times or the same grid file is used for input and output. 

V.    FOP Program Modification for Lines with Greater Than 20 Points (HPC)

      The FOP program was modified to properly handle lines with greater
      than 20 points.

VI.   New Grid Diagnostic BOOL (HPC)

      Added a new grid diagnostic, BOOL, that checks a scalar grid and
      returns a zero if the grid point has missing data, and one, if the grid
      point has data.  This diagnostic is needed for the Winter Weather
      Desk processing.

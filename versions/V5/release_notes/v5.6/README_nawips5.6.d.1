			N-AWIPS 5.6.d.1 Release Notes
				June 13, 2001	

Patch 5.6.d.1 includes several corrections to NMAP2.  It also includes 
improvements to the Hurricane Graphics program, GPTPC and the upper-air
decoder, DCUAIR.

Patch 5.6.d.1 covers development from May 30 to June 13, 2001.  

I.  NMAP2 Corrections

    A.	VG Into Background Problem (HPC)

	Corrected the problem where VG elements were put into the background 
	if the data was loaded from product generation using the single 
	time mode.

    B.  Extended Zoom in the Map Window (ALL)

	Corrected the problem where the extended zoom did not work 
	properly when zooming in map window.  The map window has been 
        modified to make the map drawing area the size specified in the 
	Nmap resource file.  Previously, the map drawing area stretched in 
	the vertical to match the shape of the entire map window taking into 
	account the widgets along the sides, e.g., the map overlays.  This 
	caused the problem of the map drawing area not having the same aspect 
	ratio as the NMAP main drawing window.  Therefore, the extended zoom 
	did not fill the data window after zooming in the map window.  
	Resource files have also been provided with this release to better 
	document the relationship between the map window drawing area and 
	the main window drawing area.  The height and width of the map window 
	(map_canvas.height/width) should be 2/3 the value of the main window 
	height and width (mainw_canvas.height/width) map window.  

    C.  Resize During Loop (ALL)

	Clicking the "Stop" button while resizing the NMAP2 display window is 
	no longer possible.  Stopping while resizing led to erroneous results.

    D.  Hide/Show Problems (ALL)

	Corrected problems with the hide/show function when switching loops.
	Previously, when switching loops, hide/show would sometimes not work 
	at all forcing the user to advance the loop to make the data visible 
	again.  Now, switching loops will always make the loop visible.
	Also, if the data is hidden, and new data is loaded, the loop is
	made visible.

    E.  Fading Among Loops (ALL)

	The fading level for each loop is now properly saved.  Previously,
	in certain cases the fade did not work properly when switching 
	loops.

    F.  Multiple Maps in Map Window (ALL)

	Corrected the problem where two maps are drawn in the map window.
	This occurred when looping, bring up the map window, canceling
	the map window, switching loops and bringing up the map window
	again.

    G.	Watch Plot Problem on Local Radar Images (SPC)

	Corrected the problem where watches and other types of 
	miscellaneous data types (e.g., airmets) are not plotted correctly
	on local radar images when the vertices of these data are located
	outside of the local radar view region. 

    H.	Corrections to Hurricane Text Product (HPC, MPC)

	The hurricane text product maker in NMAP and NMAP2 was modified
	to not include lines with 0 lat/lon points for missing forecast
	points.  The function was also corrected to properly set the
	storm ID using the VG file name.

    I.  GHM Access Added to NMAP and NMAP2 (ALL)

	Eight new restore files were added and the mod_res table was
	modified to display GHM and GHMNEST model fields.

II.   VGF Save Correction (ALL)

      Corrected the problem where VG files could not be saved to non-local
      directories with write permission.  This problem only occurred if the
      VG file did not already exist in the non-local directory.  Both NMAP
      and NMAP2 had this problem.

III.  GPTPC Improvements (TPC)

      Several improvements have been made to the hurricane graphics program,
      GPTPC.  These include priorities 1-5 on the TPC request list. Also,
      problems handling stationary and near-stationary storms have been 
      corrected.  Finally, the output storm name file has been added as 
      specified by the TPC.

IV.  Ship Soundings Added to Upper-Air Decoder (ALL)

     The upper air decoder dcuair was modified to decode ship (UU)
     data, and to improve precision in wind speed unit conversion.
     Ship reports are treated as additional stations in the decoded 
     output file.  Currently, the maximum number of additional stations 
     allowed is 25.  The table $GEMTBL/nmap/drop_parms.tbl has been 
     added to enable station model editing for dropsonde data display 
     in NMAP/NMAP2.

V.   NMAP2 Problem  (ALL)

     NMAP2 has one known scenario where the product generation graphics 
     are erroneously put into the background.  This problem also occurs 
     in V5.6.d.
     
     The scenario is as follows.  Click the map window from the main NMAP2 
     window.  Load in a new map area or overlay by clicking the "Load" 
     button.  Activate product generation and perform any action to draw 
     an object.  Load data into another loop.  Exit product generation.  
     The product generation graphics appear in the currently viewed frame 
     of the loop.  Note that invoking the map window from the data window
     does not cause this problem to occur.

     To "erase" the product generation graphics from the frame, click the
     "RELOAD" button.  Any action which re-loads the frame, e.g., "Zoom"
     also removes the product generation graphics from the frame.


*****************************************************************************

 NOTE:  The patch for V5.6.d MUST BE INSTALLED BEFORE applying V5.6.d.1.


The necessary compiling and linking instructions are contained in
the following file:

	patch_build_5.6.d.1 

To execute the script and save its output in a file type:

	cd $GEMPAK/build
	patch_build_5.6.d.1 >&! PATCH_$NA_OS & ; tail -f PATCH_$NA_OS

The output of the script will be written to PATCH_$NA_OS.

Note that the build script removes files that have been eliminated in
this patch.  These files must be removed by hand if the build script
is not executed.  A list of removed files for each patch always appears
in the file: $NAWIPS/versions/remove.log.

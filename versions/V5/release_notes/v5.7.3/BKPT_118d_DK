Experimental Hurricane Graphics Program (TPC)

A new program, GPTCWW, has been written to generate the Tropical 
Cyclone Watch/Warning graphic (previously known as the Kelly 
graphic).  This program reads the new VG TCA (tropical cyclone
advisory) element from a VG file of breakpoint information and 
plots it in the same way as the Kelly graphic program GPKGRF.  See
the NMAP2 Product Generation Improvements section for information 
on creating the VG file, and refer to the help for GPTCWW and 
parameter STRMID.

This initial version does not include the smaller Caribbean islands
(but does include Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico - all specified
in a clockwise direction), and does not include sounds, bays and 
other small bodies of water.  It uses official breakpoints only.

   Added a new GFA element and interface to PGEN.

   The new GFA element is found under class MET.  These elements are drawn in a 
   manner similar to the new Airmet and Non-convective Sigmet.  The user must 
   specify the points of the GFA using <L> mouse clicks.  A <M> mouse click 
   completes the figure.  The user must then position the text box for the GFA.  
   The text is generated from the element's attribute settings.  

   In order to change the displayed text for a GFA, select it (click Select on 
   the PGEN palette, then click on the element).  Modify the attributes as 
   desired and click on the Apply button.  The text will be updated.  In order 
   to reposition the text, click on the Move Text button.  The text box will be 
   relocated to center on the next <L> mouse click location.

   To create the From line, select the GFA.  The attribute window will be 
   populated with the From line.  Click on the Save button and the From line 
   edit window will open.  

   Note that the From line text file name will default to the type of GFA with a
   txt extension.  Unlike the new Airmet/Non-convective Sigmet, there is no GFA 
   sequence number.

   Also please note that the list of GFA types is not yet complete.  This first
   release contains only the non-special case GFAs.  The gfa.tbl contains the 
   list of currently available GFA types.  Locally a site may delete unwanted
   GFA types by removing them from this file.  New GFA types may not be added 
   locally, however.

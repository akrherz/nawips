Watch By County

	A. Fixed decoding of WFO string in final WOU (SPC)

	   Corrected a problem with the decoded of the final WOU text product.
	   The WFO string was decoded with a dollar sign appended to the WFO ids
	   in the data file. This has been removed.

	B. SPC changes to remove "MIDNIGHT" and "NOON" (SPC)

	   Modified WOU and SEV text products so that the 'MIDNIGHT' and 'NOON' 
	   phrases have been removed and  either local 12:00 or 1200 AM/PM will 
	   be used in place.  Modified SEL and PWN text products to remove the 
	   extra blank lines around the discussion portion of the text product.
	   These changes were made at the request of the SPC.

	C. Corrected Cancel watch number in watch format box

	   Fixed an error when canceling a watch, it is now possible to cancel a
	   watch number > 999 but less than 10,000.

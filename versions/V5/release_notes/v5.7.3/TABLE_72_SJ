Fix underscores in cwsu.bull

The AWC reported a problem with the station table,
cwsu.bull, for NWX. The station names contained spaces
instead of underscores between words. This was fixed
and the table is now read correctly in NWX.



Update ncepgrib2.tbl

At the request of the Production Management Branch,
the entry for parameter number 180 was made active
in ncepgrib2.tbl.

Tropical Cyclone Breakpoint Product (TPC)

The experimental tropical cyclone watch/warning/advisory text
product generated by the Kelly graphic creation program, GPKGRF,
has been modified to fix a bug which occurred when two or more 
breakpoints had identical UGC (county or marine zone) boundaries.

Hurricane Graphics Improvements for 2004 Season (TPC)

The Kelly graphic creation program, GPKGRF, has been modified to:
     o prevent storms in the far eastern Atlantic from overplotting
       the NOAA logo;
     o allow a variable number of forecast intensity text lines in
       the legend box;
     o add an input parameter option for STRMID to bypass creation
       of the watch/warning text message (default is to create 
       the message);
     o update track error tables for the 2004 hurricane season.

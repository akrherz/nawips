Modified SWH BUFR Files to be Consistent with UKMET Versions (AWC)

Changes were made to the programs which process high-level 
significant weather (SWH) BUFR files (SIGWXCNV, BUFRENC and 
SIGAVGF) to ensure that content of the BUFR files is consistent 
with that which is generated by the UKMET:
     o specify cloud definition points in counterclockwise order;
     o adjust front movement by 180 degrees;
     o specify front speed in m/s;
     o correct turbulence definition table values;
     o use a replication factor of one for volcano points.

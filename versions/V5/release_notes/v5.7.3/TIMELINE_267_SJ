Timeline enhancements

A few changes have been made to the timeline in NMAP2. The
most visible is that the "Set Time" selection has been removed
and the "Current Time" has been changed to a push button.

The "Set Time" functionality has been replaced by the Reference
Time in the Range/Interval window. The Reference Time allows
the user to specify the end time for the timeline, for 
observational data, or the start time, for forecast data.
The calendar window used by the Set Time function has been 
moved to the Reference Time. Therefore, the user may type
a date/time string or use the calendar interface to select
a Reference Time.

The "Current Time" button updates the tick mark selection
outline. For observed data, the Reference Time is erased
and the tick marks for the latest data are selected. For
forecast data, the Reference Time is erased and the tick
marks for the earlier forecasts (the left side of the
timeline) are selected. The other attributes of the timeline
are unaffected, i.e., range, interval, number of frames, etc.

Another enhancement is that if the user selects only a new
restore file, for grids, or a new station model, for surface
or upper air data, then the timeline will not be updated. 
Previously any new data selection would update the entire
timeline.

Finally, the Reference Time information is now saved to the
SPF files for forecast data. Since saving absolute times would
not work for real time data, a delta relative to the current
cycle time is saved. That is, the difference between the 
forecast cycle and the user input reference time is stored
in the SPF.

Re-engineer Library Code for VG to ASCII Conversion (AWC, ALL)

A new table-driven VG to ASCII conversion program, VG2UKA, has
been developed which reads user input parameters, tables, and a
VG file to generate an ASCII output file in the UKMET browsable
format.  This program will allow for a more generic means of
creating ASCII files than the current capabilities included in 
program SIGWXCNV.  VG2UKA is being released for TESTING and
EVALUATION purposes ONLY.  The plan is to replace the program
SIGWXCNV in the next release after parallel testing is conducted.

VG2UKA is written as a GEMPAK program with the GEMPAK text based
user interface.  Additional help on the program can be obtained by
running the GEMPAK help facility in the program or viewing the
GEMPAK help file $GEMHLP/hlp/vg2uka.hlp.

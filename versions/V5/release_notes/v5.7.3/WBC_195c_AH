Watch By County

	A. Fixed an error when issuing the same watch more than 2 times (SPC)

	   Corrected the problem when a watch was issued more than 2 times, it
	   caused the ww####.vgf file to be empty. When creating List elements 
	   from the active watch counties, modified the software in how it 
	   determines which List element to delete from the .DEFAULT.vgf file.  
	   This bug was reported by the SPC 5/12/04.

	B. Fixed the WCN decoder DCWCN (SPC, CDB)

           It was noticed that the raw WCNs contained extra lines between the
	   MND and the UGC line. This line caused the decoder to hang. These 
	   lines are now being skipped and there are extra checks for finding and
	   validating the VTEC line.

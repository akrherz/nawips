NALARM

Two problems were resolved with NALARM. The new product
button was not flashing when a new bulletin arrived. 
This has been fixed. There was also a problem with 
printing bulletins with control characters to some
new printers at the SDM desk. The control characters
are now stripped from the file before attempting to
print.

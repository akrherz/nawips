I.  Product Generation Changes

    A.  NMAP2 Product Generation Improvements

    	1.  A time interpolation function has been added.  The Interp button on 
	    the PGEN palette can be used to perform interpolations between two 
 	    PGEN elements.

	    Interp can only be used on closed lines, sigmets, or the new 
	    airmets/sigmets (found under class MET).  Interp will not function 
	    with all other elements. 
	   
	    Clicking on the interp button starts the interpolation window.  The
	    user selects the first element for interpolation, then selects a 
	    second element of the same type.  No element type mismatch is 
	    permitted -- if the first element was an airmet, the second element 
	    must be an airmet as well.

	    The new airmets/sigmets contain an embedded forecast time.  For 
	    these elements the time of the starting and ending figures will be 
	    placed in the Starting Time and Ending Time windows.  For all other 
	    valid elements, the user will have to supply a starting and ending 
	    time.  This should be just the hour (i.e. "3", not "3Z").  The user 
	    may then set the interval value.  This is time interval for which 
	    new elements will be created.  A value of 1 means a new element will
	    be added for every hour between the starting and ending elements.

	    Clicking on the Interpolate button triggers the actual interpolation.
	    The new elements will be drawn between the starting and ending
	    elements.  The attributes for the new elements will be based upon
	    the starting element.  If the new elements have an embedded forecast 
	    time, their forecast time will correspond to the staring time plus 
	    the number of hours they are offset.  So if MET/airmets are selected 
	    and the starting element is hour 0, the ending element is 3 and the 
	    interval is 1, two new airmets will be created, one with a forecast 
	    time of 1 and one with a forecast time of 2.

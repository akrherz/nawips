Watch-By-County

    Addition of Marine Zones to Watch text product suite (SPC)

	Added marine zones to the WCL, SEV, WOU initial, enhanced WSM, the 
	WOU update and WOU final text messages. The marine zones may be turned 
	on or off in $GEMTBL/config/prefs.tbl file with the tag 'ADD_MARZON'. 
	Currently, they are turned OFF.  The general reference of 'Coastal Waters'
	and the individual Great Lakes information remains as it is currently
	processed in the SEL, PWN and SAW.

        The marine zones have been combined with the US counties into a 
	set of map files, $GEMPAK/maps/??mzcn.nws, where ?? is tp (top), 
	hi (high), me (medium) or lo (low) resolution. In the file 
	$GEMTBL/config/mapfile.tbl, a new entry has been added for Marine 
	zones/Counties as the alias 'wbcmarine' which sets the NMAP2 map as 
	'himzcn.nws'. In the map overlay table, $GEMTBL/nmap/mapovl.nmap, the 
	marine zone/county map has been added as 'Marine_Cnty' and it appears 
	in the NMAP2 map overlay window. Attributes for the map may be changed 
	in this table. 

	In the locator window at the bottom right of the main NMAP2 window,
	'MZ_CNTY' has been added to facilitate locating and identifying counties 
	and marine zones. It is currently set to display the station id in the
	locator window. This may be changed to show the station name in 
	$GEMTBL/nmap/locator.tbl. If the station name is selected, the county 
	names will appear in the window, however, due to the length of the marine 
	zones, their station id will still be displayed as the station name in the 
	locator window. The marine zone names file, $GEMTBL/stns/marinenames.tbl, 
	the marine zones ids are listed with the full marine zone names used by 
	the text products.

	Note: it maybe necessary to switch to COUNTY in the locator for islands
	enveloped by a marine zone to determine which county the island belongs.

	In NMAP2 PGEN, a new list element has been added 'WBC MZ'. This list
	element functions the same way as the 'COUNTY' List element. When creating
	the enhanced WSM watch product, it is only this 'WBC MZ' List element 
	that is used, the 'COUNTY' List element will no longer be used. 
	Therefore, any changes to the display of the COUNTY List element will 
	have to be made to the WBC MZ List element in $GEMTBL/pgen/setting.tbl.

    Decoder Changes for DCWOU and DCWCN

	The WOU decoder, DCWOU, and the WCN deocder, DCWCN have been modified to
	used the combined county/marine zone table, $GEMTBL/stns/mzcntys.tbl, 
	when decoding these two types of reports. See dcwou.hlp and dcwcn.hlp
	for details on how the counties and marine zones will appear in the
	decoded files.	
 
    New bounds files for combined Counties and Marine Zones

	Two new bounds files have been created in support of the addition of
	marine zones to Watch-By-County. They are $GEMTBL/bounds/mzcntybnds.tbl
	and $GEMTBL/bounds/mzcntybnds.tbl.info.  The bounds files, all map files
	and the marine zone/county tables were derived from the AWIPS Map Database 
	Coastal Marine Zone shapefile.


    Transfer of information from WCC window to Watch Format window (SPC) 

        In the Watch County Coordination window, the storm type, 
	expiration time, replacement watch numbers and the forecaster's 
	name will be transfered to the 'Format Watch' window when the WCC
	has been saved.

Add interpolation type and direction flags to GRIB tables

Two flag value columns have been added to the tables used
by NAGRIB and NDFDG2 for decoding GRIB and GRIB2 data files.
The flag values are not used at this time. They have been
added in preparation for the addition of the automatic
horizontal remapping.

The tables should be updated, however, the new source code
will still read the old file format.

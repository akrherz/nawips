TRACK 249:  QSCT
TASK NAME:  QuikScat data--Allow plotting as arrows and directional arrows

The capability to plot QuikScat data as directional and regular arrows has been
added to NMAP2 and GPMAP.  A type attribute, which specifies the type of wind
vector has been added to the ARRW attribute line in miscset.tbl read by NMAP2:
ARRW size/head_size/width/type.  The value of type determines which of three
buttons in the NMAP2 user interface will pop up when the "Edit Source" button
is clicked.  The three buttons have the labels:  (a) "Barb"--only wind barbs
can be plotted,  (b) "Arrw"--only directional arrows can be plotted, and (c)
"Arrw/Barb"--the type of wind vectors (directional arrow, regular arrow, or wind
barb) is selectable.  If type is 1, then the button will be labeled "Arrw".  If
type is 2, then the button will be labeled "Barb".  If type is 3, 4, or 5, then
the button will be labeled "Arrw/Barb", with the initial selection being 
directional arrow, regular arrow, and wind barb respectively.  If type is
missing or 0, then if the arrow head size is greater than 0, then type is set
to 1 for directional arrows, otherwise it is set to 2 for wind barbs.  All
other values of type are considered invalid and will be set to 5 for user
selectable wind vector with wind barb set initially.  The value of type has
been set to 5 for QSCT and QSCT_HI in miscset.tbl.

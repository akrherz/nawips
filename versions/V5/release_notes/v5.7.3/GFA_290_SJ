GAMET text production

A new library has been added that will be used to 
create the GAMET text product, which is part of the
Graphical Forecast for Aviation (GFA) project. The
library was created in collaboration with FSL.

The library is not currently used, but will be 
implemented in NMAP2 in a future release.

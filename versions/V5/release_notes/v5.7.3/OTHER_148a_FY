TRACK 148:  OTHER
TASK NAME:  Unassociated Tasks--Use GG_CSIG to display the extrapolated 1 and 2
	    hour forecasts

The capability to display the extrapolated 1-hour and 2-hour convective SIGMETs
has been added to NMAP2 and GPMAP.  Since all shapes (area, line, and isolated)
are to be plotted, the three "TYPE" lines for the different shapes have been
replaced in miscset.tbl for CSIG with "TYPE" lines for initial (0-hour), 1-hour,
and 2-hour.  The "TYPE" lines has an on/off flag which determines whether that
type (which hour) will be plotted and a color number.  The on/off flag and color
can also be changed in the "CSIG Attributes" box which pops up when the
"Edit Source" button in NMAP2 is clicked.  In release 5.7.3 there were five
flags:  Sequence ID, time, Direction/speed, Flight Level, and Intensity.  The
Sequence ID FLAG line in miscset.tbl has been replaced with three Sequence ID
FLAG lines, one associated with each of the three hours.  If the initial hour is
plotted, then the original five flags will be applied for the initial hour
CSIG.  If the initial hour is not plotted and only one extrapolated hour is
to be plotted, then the original flags (except for the Sequence ID) will be
applied.  If the initial hour is not plotted and both 1-hour and 2 hour CSIGs
are to be plotted, then the original flags (except for the Sequence ID) will be
applied to the 1-hour CSIG.  The original flags (except for the Sequence ID)
will always be applied to the lowest hour CSIG plotted).

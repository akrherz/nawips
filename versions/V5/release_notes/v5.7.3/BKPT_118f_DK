JTWC Product Changes for 2004 Season (ALL)

The hurricane decoder DCHRCN was modified to decode 64 kt winds
from JTWC (Joint Typhoon Warning Center) instead of 100 kt winds,
in response to a change they made effective June 1, 2004.  The
decoder was also modified to bypass decoding of "repackaged" 
advisories from JTWC for eastern and central Pacific storms.  Only
the original TPC and CPHC advisories for these storms will be 
decoded, along with JTWC advisories for western Pacific storms.

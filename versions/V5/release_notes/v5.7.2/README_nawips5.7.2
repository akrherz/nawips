               N-AWIPS 5.7.2 Release Notes
                   	03/12/04 

Version 5.7.2 covers development from December 12, 2003 to March 12, 2004.  

******************************************************************************

I.  Product Generation Changes
	
    A.	NMAP2 Product Generation Improvements 

	1. Added VOR Point Generation for Alaskan SIGMET Production (AR)

           The International SIGMET GUI has been modified to add an option
	   to create Alaskan land based SIGMETs using VOR points.  Click
	   on the "VOR" radio button in the "International SIGMET Edit" GUI
	   to select this option.

	2. Jet Object Enhancements (AWC)

           The recently added jet element now plots its wind barbs with the 
           shaft centered at tangent of the jet line.

           In addition, flight level deltas may now be plotted under the flight 
           level text.  Values may be input in the "Barb Info" GUI.

           The following rules now apply to jet wind barbs:

           a) Speeds are limited to the range 80 <= spd <= 400;
           b) Blank levels are set to 300; all levels < 1000;
           c) A single blank flight level for the delta is set to 0;
           d) If both deltas are blank, the deltas are not plotted.

	3. Preliminary "Snap Shot" AIRMET/SIGMET GUI Added (AWC)

	   A first level capability to create snap shot AIRMETS and 
	   non-convective SIGMETS has been added to NMAP2 product generation.
	   This release is ONLY for testing and evaluation purposes.

           The new AIRMET and non-convective SIGMET (NCSIGMET) elements are 
           found under class "MET" on the NMAP2 "pgpalette" GUI.  These 
           elements are drawn in a manner similar to the CCFP element.  Click 
           the "AIRMET" or "NON CONV" icon to invoke the "AIRMET Create/Edit" 
           or "Non-Convective SIGMET Create/Edit" GUI, respectively.  Select
	   the desired attributes of the AIRMET or NCSIGMET from the GUI.  
	   The choices available in the GUI, e.g., "Forecast Hour" are 
	   hard-coded for this release.  Note that the next release will 
           allow the available choices to be specified in the tables, 
           $GEMTBL/airmet.tbl and $GEMTBL/ncon_sigmets.tbl.  To specify the
           desired AIRMET/NCSIGMET points, click the left mouse button.  Click
           the middle mouse button to complete the figure.  Position the
	   text box using the cursor and the ghost box as a guide.  Click
	   the left mouse button to place the text box at the desired location.
	   The text is generated from the element's attribute settings.  

	   In order to change the displayed text for an AIRMET/NCSIGMET, select
	   the desired object.  Modify the attributes as desired and click on 
           the "Apply" button.  The text is updated.  In order to reposition 
           the text, click on the "Move Text"  button.  The text box is 
           relocated to center on the next left mouse click location.  

	   To create the From line, click on the "Save" button and the From 
           line edit window will open.  This window is the same as the one for
           the existing AIRMET/NCSIGMET. 

	   Note that the From line text file name will default to the type of 
	   AIRMET/NCSIGMET plus the sequence number (i.e. Turb_2.txt).  

	4. Added Counties to the Watch Status Text Message product (SPC)

           Modified the production of the watch status text message such that in
           conjunction with the current text output file, WSM_####_YYMMDD.txt an
           additional file is created, WSMenh_####_YYMMDD.txt.  This new file
           has the same information found in the current status text message,
           WSM_####_YYMMDD.txt, and it also lists the active county UG codes
           and county names.  The listing of the UG codes and county names are 
           in the same format as the WOU-initial product.

           The following are the steps for creating the new watch status 
           message with counties:

           a. Draw watch box and format it for issuing.
           b. Issue the watch box.
           c. Draw the status line.
           d. Select a List element on the screen and click on those elements to
              be turned off. Click 'Apply' or the middle mouse button to end
              editing.
           e. In 'PROD', create the watch status messages.  The enhanced WSM is
              created at this point.  The counties do not appear in the current
              WSM format window.

	   To help the forecaster in turning on and off the List element
           counties, the toggling on and off of 'cluster counties' has been
           added to the List element edit window.  Currently, clustering only
           works with the 'COUNTY' List element.

           The color, size, width and marker type of the List element marker may
           be changed in $GEMTBL/pgen/setting.tbl.  Modify the List element
           attributes for 'county'.

        5. Volcanic Ash Advisory (VAA) Text Product and Graphic (NESDIS, AR)

	   Several improvements and enhancements have been made to the creation
	   of the VAA graphic and text product in NMAP.  NMAP product 
           generation now allows for the graphical generation of the VAA text 
           product forecast hour information using layers.

   		a. Volcano Specification 

		The volcano specification remains unchanged.  However, analysts 
                should choose "Create Volcano in Layers" which will configure 
                the product generation session such that each forecast hour 
                is in a separate 'layer'.  The volcano symbol is located in 
                layer #1 and the analyst must be in layer #1 to select the 
                volcano symbol and generate the VAA text product.

                b. Volcanic Ash Clouds  
       
                Ash clouds for forecast hours 00, 06, 12 and 18 are in 
                layers 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively.  Analysts must be in the 
                proper layer in order to edit a particular forecast hour.  Note
		that the "VAA" GUI pops down when switching layers.  Therefore,
		the user must re-click the "VAC" Object after switching layers
		to re-invoke the "VAA" GUI.

   		Note that the current functionality (not using layers) 
                remains unchanged and may be continued until forecast 
                information is required.

		c. The VAA table, $GEMTBL/pgen/vaa.tbl

   		The VAA text product generation remains generally the same. 
                However, users may now specify any variety of generalized text 
                products via the table vaa.tbl.  For instance, a VAA test 
                message may now be generated without editing a volcano.  Click 
                on the VOL button to bring up the usual volcano selection 
                dialogue.  At the bottom, select 'TEST' from the pull-down menu 
                and then 'GO...'.  The VAA text product form ('VAA Create') 
                appears with appropriate information already filled in.  Edits 
                may be made and the text product creation may be invoked. 

     		Also, specialized text products may be specified from the 
                'VAA Create' form.  The choices appear next to the header 
                number.  Choices relating to specific volcanos should appear 
                here, such as the 'End VAA'.

     		The choices available to the user in the two locations 
                ('VAA Volcano Create'and 'VAA Create') as well as the 
                content in the text product are defined in the table vaa.tbl. 
                This delivery includes the following choices:

     		Location 1 (VAA Create) - 
		NORMAL - contains all of the usual text product entries,
		END    - this is the 'End VAA' product,
		QUICK  - this is the quick VAA product for an unexpected 
                         eruption,
		NEAR   - this is for ash near a particular location.

     		Location 2 (VAA Volcano Create) - 
		TEST   - for a test VAA text product,
		RESUME - for resuming normal operations.
   
   		Directory paths - Paths for the location of the LPF files and 
                text products may now be specified.

	6. Advanced Objective Dvorak Technique (AODT) GUI Added (TPC)

	   A preliminary GUI for the NAWIPS implementation of the AODT has been
	   developed for this release.  In this release the GUI provides the 
           required AODT widgets, however, most of the AODT functionality will 
           be delivered in the next release.  When fully implemented, the GUI 
           will allow the user to run the AODT code as contributed by CIMSS at 
           the University of Wisconsin.  These capabilities include 
           deterministic Dvorak scene type and classification as well as AODT 
           history file management.

	   The AODT GUI is invoked by clicking on the AODT labeled icon next to
	   the cloud height icon above the main NMAP2 data display area.  
           Clicking the cursor in the data display area displays the latitude 
           and longitude in the "AODT" GUI.

    B.  Product Generation Pre/Post-Processing Programs

	1. Re-engineer library code for ASCII to BUFR conversion (ALL)

	   The BUFR encoder program BUFRENC (introduced in release 5.7.1) has
	   been corrected for bugs found by the CDB (in encoding BUFR files
	   sequentially) and the AWC (in processing tropical storm, volcano
	   and radiation messages).  There are now no known bugs in this
	   program.

	2. Updated VGF-to-ASCII encoding for new jet element (AWC)

	   The VGF-to-ASCII conversion program for high-level significant
	   weather charts, SIGWXCNV, has been modified to convert jets in 
	   either the grouped format (group type JET) or in the new jet
	   element format.  A single VG file can contain jet data in either
	   or both formats.  The encoding of the new jet element is ready
	   for AWC testing.

	3. Added Degree Symbol for Freezing Level Text Box (AWC)

	   The freezing level text box will now show a degree sign in 
           between the '0' and ':', followed by the freezing level.

        4. Added VTEC to WOU-initial and WOUPDT (SPC)

           The VTEC line may be added to the WOU-initial and WOUPDT text
           products.  The settings for the product type code (k), action code
           (aaa), office id (cccc) and significance code (s) are found in the
           table: $GEMTBL/txtprd/woudef.tbl.  It is possible to specify if
           the VTEC code should be included, included without the product type
           code or included with the product type code.  There are separate
           entries for the WOU-initial and WOU update text products in the
           table.

           Currently, both products are set to include the VTEC line with the
           product type code.  The WOU-initial has the product type code set to
           'X' ( Experimental VTEC in an operational product) and the action
           code as 'NEW'.  The WOU update program has the product code set to
           'E' (Experimental product).  The action code will be set in the
           program to 'CON' for active counties and 'CAN' for a cancel product.
           These settings are based upon the current draft version of
           NWS VTEC 10-1701. 

	5. Changed the Default Filename for Outlook Text Products (SPC)

           Changed the default outlook text product file name from using the
           abbreviated group type name to using the full group type name.
           A new table, $GEMTBL/pgen/otlfilnam.tbl, has been created to match
           the abbreviated group type names to their full names.  If the
           abbreviated group type name cannot be found, then the abbreviated
           name will be used.  If a '-' is specified in the table as the file 
           name prefix, then (1) no group type name will be prefixed to the 
           template output file name and (2) the leading template underscore 
           is removed.

	6. MDPSPC Rounding Correction (SPC) 

	   Fixed the rounding of the latitude and longitude values written 
           by the program MDPSPC that creates the mesoscale discussion text
           product.  The fix ensures that the values are rounded to the 
           nearest 0.01 degree.

	7. VGF Clipping (SSA)

           A new program, joinvgf, has been written to join VGF files that have 
           previously been clipped by the program 'clipvgf' using the 'exact'
           option.  The program joins open lines (special and regular) 
           and fronts only.  Groupings with other objects are maintained.

           Usage: 

           joinvgf vgf_file1 vgf_file2 joined_vgf_file [tolerance]

           The optional tolerance (specified in kilometers) allows lines or 
           fronts that are not exactly touching at their endpoints to be 
           joined.  The default value is 0.5 kilometers.

	8. Hurricane Graphics Improvements for 2004 Season (TPC)

           The Kelly graphic creation program, GPKGRF, has been modified to:

   		o improve the legend by adding a TPC attribution line, the
     	 	  direction of movement, and intensity information to the 
                  legend box;
   		o add a letter (H, S, D) showing the intensity at each 
		  forecast point;
   		o improve the breakpoint display for several Caribbean islands;
   		o allow more breakpoint options for the Chesapeake Bay, tidal
		  Potomac and Delaware Bay;
   		o allow multiple warnings for bays, rivers and lakes.

	   Also, the official U.S. break points have been added to the NMAP2
	   cursor locator function.

	9. Tropical cyclone breakpoint product (TPC)

	   The experimental tropical cyclone watch/warning/advisory text
	   product generated by the Kelly graphic creation program, GPKGRF,
	   has been modified to include the characters 'E.' for experimental
	   at the beginning of each VTEC line.

II.  NMAP2 Display Improvements 

    A.  Automatically Load an SPF File from the Command Line (ALL)

	NMAP2 has been enhanced to allow SP files (SPFs) to be loaded
	from the command line upon initiation of the program.  The following
	command line option flags are now available:	

	1. -s filename specifies that the desired SPF is loaded into the
	   NMAP2 data window after NMAP2 starts.  In this case, the user
	   may review the entries and must click the "Load" button to
	   load the data into the display loops.  

	2. -as filename specifies that the desired SPF is loaded and all data
	   associated with the SPF are loaded into the NMAP2 loops without any
	   user interaction.  For example, nmap2 -as example.spf starts NMAP2 
           and loads all loops with the data specified in example.spf.

	The SPF file name is either a relative or full path name.  Type
	nmap2 -h for help on the nmap2 command line arguments. 

    B.  Range/Interval Selection Added to User Interface (ALL)

	NMAP2 has been enhanced to allow the user to control the time range
	and interval that appears in the time line for the dominant data type.
	This functionality allows the user to specify the frame times that
	are available for selection in the time line GUI.
	
	Click the "Range/Int" button on the "Data Selection Window" GUI to
	invoke the "Range/Interval Input" GUI. 	The "Range/Interval Input" GUI 
	allows the user to enter interval and range in days, hours and minutes.
	Blank entries are equivalent to entering a 0 for the range and interval
	entries.
	
	For example, say the dominant data type is radar data and the user
	desires to see radar imagery once per hour for a day.  Enter "1" under
	the "DAY" column in the "Range:" row and "1" under the "HR" column for 
	the "Interval:" row.  After clicking the "Accept" button the time line
	will include frames starting at the most recent hour going back one
	day in time assuming the data are available in the database for the
	entire period. 

        A reference time may also be selected.  For observed data, the 
        reference time is the last time that appears on the right of the 
        time line.  For forecast data, the reference time is the first time 
        that appears on the left of the time line.  If the reference time is 
        blank, the last marker for observed data is the time associated with 
        the most recent data.  When the reference time is blank and forecast 
        data is dominant, the first marker is the first forecast time in the 
        data set, usually F000.

	The initial values for Range and Interval are set in datatype.tbl. The
	reference time is initialized to a blank value.  If the entries in the
        "Range/Interval Input" GUI are not modified, then the time line uses
	the values in the datatype.tbl to determine its range and interval in
	the identical fashion as previous versions of NMAP2.

	The following describes the rules of operation for various
	combinations of Interval and Reference Time (RT):

	1. If the RT is set but the interval is not,
	     a. For observation or analysis data, the time line displays
	   	all available data up to the RT.
	   	e.g.: RT=1630Z, METAR time markers would be at 16Z, 15Z,
	   	14Z, etc.

	     b. For forecast data, the time line displays all available
	   	data after the RT.
	   	e.g.: RT=1630Z, the markers for the 12Z ETA would be at 18Z,
	   	21Z, 00Z, etc.

	2. If the RT and the interval are both set,
	     a. For observation or analysis data, the time line displays
	   	markers at a constant interval ending at the RT. All time
	   	markers will be computed relative to the RT.
	   	e.g.: RT=1500Z, Int=3 hrs, METAR time markers would be at 15Z,
	   	12Z, 09Z, etc.

	     b. For forecast data, the time line displays markers starting
	   	at the RT and marching forward at a constant interval.
	        e.g.: RT=1500Z, Int=6 hrs, the markers for the 12Z ETA would
	        be at 15Z, 21Z, 03Z, etc.

	The range controls the maximum number of markers that can be displayed
	for the current dominant data type.  For example, the default range for
	METAR data is 2 days.  This range displays 48 markers of the hourly 
        data.  If the user sets the range to 4 days, then 96 markers are 
        displayed.  The user may then change the interval to display fewer 
        times on the time line.

	The above rules apply to all data types.  However, for imagery there 
        are additional rules to account for auto update.  When there is no RT 
        and no interval set, the auto-update behaves normally.  If there is a 
        value for the interval, then the auto-update will wait until the next 
        interval time to attempt to load data.  For example, if the last radar 
        image is at 1500Z and the interval is set to 15 minutes, images that 
        arrive at 1505Z and 1510Z will not be loaded.  The next image loaded 
        by the auto-update will be at 1515Z. 

	Setting the RT when imagery is the dominant data type turns the
	auto-update feature off.

	*** Important Please Note ***

	The "Range/Int" must not be used concurrently with the "Set Time"
	function.  We plan to eliminate the "Set Time" function in the next
	release.

    C.	Map Selection GUI Enhancement (ALL)

	The selection of predefined areas and overlays in the "MAP Selection" 
        GUI are now scroll lists instead a fixed check list.  This change 
        allows more predefined area and overlay selections to be available 
        to the user without increasing the size of the "Map Selection" GUI.

    D.  Decode and Display Sustained Surface Winds AIRMETs (AWC)

	AIRMETS for sustained surface winds (coded as 'AIRMET STG SFC
	WND|WNDS|WIND|WINDS') are now decoded and displayed in NMAP2
	and GPMAP.  The display is labeled with the characters '30' with 
	a 30 knot wind barb beneath the characters.

III. Decoder Improvements

    A.  Aircraft Decoder Improvements (ALL)

	The aircraft decoder, DCAFT, handling of RECCO reports has been
	improved.  The changes corrected the decoding of aircraft altitudes 
        of 10,000 meters or more and the decoding of dew points less than 
        or equal to -50 degrees C.

    B.  GFS MOS Changes for Sky Cover, Ceiling Height, Visibility (ALL)

	On May 18, 2004 the GFS MOS content will be modified for the
	above 3 types of data.  The decoder, DCGMOS, and the packing 
	table have been modified to prepare for this change.  There is
	no impact on current operations.  (See Technical Implementation
	Notice (TIN) 04-09 for details.)

    C.  Improvements to the International SIGMET Decoder (AR, AWC, NESDIS)

	The international SIGMET decoder, DCISIG, was modified to account for
	variations in the SIGMETS from the standard formats.  The following 
        improvements have been made:

	1.  Add decoding of additional phenomena:  SQL TS (SQ), FZRA (IC),
    	    and MTW (MW) for United States SIGMETs.
	2.  Add key words "XPNDG" and "EXPANDING" to IS_MOV.  The suffix
    	    "WDS" was also added to the search for the movement direction. 
            These changes were made to improve decoding of Canadian SIGMETs.
	3.  Allow for unabbreviated cardinal points for a side of a line.
	4.  Enhance the search for flight levels for Canadian SIGMETS.

	Alaskan SIGMETs having an origin of PANC are decoded.  Duplicate 
        SIGMETs with origins of PAFA or PAJN have been seen, but are not 
        decoded since we were informed that the origin should only be PANC.

    D.  METAR Decoder Improvements (NCO)

	A problem with the metar decoder, DCMETR which was reported in the 
        SDM log on December 26, 2003 was corrected.  A bulletin fragment 
        which began with the characters 'SPUR PA' had caused subsequent PMSL 
        data not to be stored.

	The metar decoder, DCMETR and the TAF decoder, DCTAF have been updated
	to allow additional report decoding by checking for a 'P' or 'M' 
        indicator for visibilities encoded in meters, checking for the max 
        wind indicator 'P', and checking for the max gust indicator 'GP'.

    E.  Wind speed data resolution in GEMPAK upper air files (SPC)

        Changed the data resolution and number of bits used for 
        storage for the wind speed in upper air data.  The values are set 
        in the file creation file for files with the various "parts" saved 
        separately.  Changed the resolution to save the value to the nearest 
        0.01 m/s.

    F.  Added Report Time to Text of Land Synoptic Reports in Decoder (TPC)

	The land surface decoder, DCLSFC, has been enhanced to prepend the 
        bulletin time before the report text written to the GEMPAK file. 
        This changed was requested by the TPC.

IV.  General Improvements

    A.  Precipitation Accumulation Improvements (ALL)

	Enhanced the precipitation accumulation algorithm to handle the Canadian
	model precipitation fields.  The Canadian model accumulates 
        precipitation from the beginning time of the model run to each forecast
 	hour.  That is, at F12, there is a 12-hour accumulation; at F24, 
        24-hour; at F96, 96-hour, etc.  This change also required corrections 
        to the code to properly handle precipitation accumulations for 
        greater than 100 hours.

    B.  GIF Driver Fill Improvements (AWC)

    	Modified the GIF driver to draw the various fill patterns. Previously, 
        any pattern selected would be drawn as a filled pattern.  This
	development was done by the AWC in collaboration with the Computing
	Development Branch.

    C.  Add RADAT and CWA data to NWX (AWC)

	The RADAT freezing level data and the CWA Center Weather Advisories data
	have been added to NWX.  The RADAT data selection is listed under 
        "Observations" and the CWA data is listed under "Aviation Forecast".

    D.	Land Synoptic Data in NWX (TPC)

        Added the ability to display raw land synoptic reports in NWX.  These
	reports can be listed by clicking on "Synoptic Data" under the 
	"Observed Data" group in the "Data Selection" GUI.

V.  Bug Corrections 

    A.  Convective SIGMET Display Problem (AWC)

    	Modified the convective SIGMET decoder, DCCSIG, to decode NIL type
    	reports.  Also, modified the display of convective SIGMET and outlooks
    	to only display the last issuance for each region and that they appear
    	immediately and remain only as long as there is no nil issuance for 
    	that particular region (west, central, east). 

    B.  Fixed Circle Elements in VG Device Driver (OPC)

	The OPC reported that circles written to a VG file by the device driver
	could not be edited.  The device driver was corrected to properly 
        write circles to a VG file.

    C.  Graph-To-Grid Problem (OPC)

	Corrected the graph-to-grid program to properly handle bound lines
	with greater than 500 points. 

    D.  Outlook Message Creation Problem with Layers (SPC)

	Corrected an outlook message creation bug when using layering in 
        PGEN.  If a "SIGNIFICANT SEVERE" line is in several layers and the 
        lines are not grouped to that particular group layer, the lines would 
        appear in other layer outlook product text messages.  This bug was 
        found by the SPC.

VI. Known Bugs  

    A.  Default Button In Custom Map Definition GUI (ALL)

        The "DEF Content" button in the "Custom Map Definition" GUI
        does not work.  It is supposed to list the default map
        projection for selected geographic regions.

VII. Map and Table File Updates

    The following summarizes significant table changes.  See 
    $NAWIPS/versions/tables.log and nawips.log for a complete list of all 
    table and map file changes. 

    A.  Updated GRIB tables (ALL)

	Added four new vertical coordinates to $GEMTBL/grid/vcrdgrib1.tbl.  
        They are:

	248  Shallow convective cloud bottom level                  SCBL     0
	249  Shallow convective cloud top level                     SCTL     0
	251  Deep convective cloud bottom level                     DCBL     0
	252  Deep convective cloud top level                        DCTL     0

	Also added two new GRIB parameter tables.  Parameter table version
	numbers 129 and 130 were assigned to allow the definition of more
	local use parameters.  Tables necessary for use in nagrib were also 
        created.

    B.  AVN to GFS Renaming Project (ALL)

	A project has been established in the NCO to rename the AVN model to
	GFS.  The multi-phased project is expected to be completed in the 
        Fall of 2004.  The CDB has added the alias name GFS to datatype.tbl 
        and mod_res.tbl.  The alias AVN still exists and will remain in the 
        tables until the end of the project.  Currently, the GFS alias 
        references data in the AVN data directory.  As more parts of the 
        project get finished, and the GFS data directory is established, the 
        alias will be changed to reference the new directory name.

    C.  World Map Files Updated in Europeon Area (ALL)

	N-AWIPS map files have been updated to account for changes in 
        European political boundaries. 

    D.  U.S. Time Zone Maps and Bounds Files Added (SPC)

	Maps and bounds files have been added to depict U.S. time zones.
	The map is available in the NMAP2 overlays scroll list.  In addition,
	the locator can be set to "TIMEZONE_NAME" to display the time zone
	as the cursor is moved.  The time zone map files are in $GEMMAPS and
	are named *tzus.nws, where the * prefix indicates the resolution
	using the same convention as other map files.

    E.  Updated Bounds File for Tropical Cyclone Graphics (TPC)

	Modified the hurricane bounds files extending the eastern boundaries 
        to 50E and northern to almost 90N.

IX. Configuration Management Changes 

       ***** Site Administrators Important Please Note ****

    A.  GUI Programs, Tables, and Help Files Moved to $GEMPAK Source Tree (ALL)

	Several important configuration management changes occurred in this 
        release.  The nprogs directory tree has been removed.  All GUI 
        programs now reside at $GEMPAK/source/programs/gui.  As a result, the 
        environmental variables that referenced nprogs subdirectories have 
        been modified in the NAWIPS .cshrc file.  In addition, new 
        environmental variables were created for NCOLOR, NFAX, and NSHARP.
	All GUI tables that used to reside in $NAWIPS/tables have been
	moved to $GEMTBL.  Tables for a given GUI program, e.g., NWX have a
	subdirectory under $GEMTBL, e.g., $GEMTBL/nwx that contains its 
        respective table files.  All GUI help files that used to reside in 
        $NAWIPS/help have been moved to $GEMHLP.

	All GUI programs now use link scripts instead of make files to be
	consistent with other N-AWIPS programs.

	New .cshrc and .profile files are provided to reflect the above 
        changes.  They are named .cshrc_7.7.2 and profile_5.7.2, respectively.  
        Please use them as a guide for updating site configuration files.

    B.  HPUX10 No Longer Supported (ALL)

	Since vendor support for the HPUX10 operating system has terminated,
	N-AWIPS executables and support for HPUX10 will no longer be
	provided.  Support will continue for HPUX11.

    C.  N-AWIPS Support Eliminated for VMS 

	Code was removed that referenced the archaic VMS operating system.

    D.  N-AWIPS Support for AIX5 (NCO)

	Support for AIX5 executables is now available.


*****************************************************************************


The necessary compiling and linking instructions are contained in
the following file:

     release_build_5.7.2 

To execute the script and save its output in a file type:

     cd $GEMPAK/build
     release_build_5.7.2 >&! RELEASE_$NA_OS & ; tail -f RELEASE_$NA_OS

The output of the script will be written to RELEASE_$NA_OS.

Note that the build script removes files that have been eliminated in
this version.  These files must be removed by hand if the build script
is not executed.  A list of removed files for each release always appears
in the file: $NAWIPS/versions/remove.log.

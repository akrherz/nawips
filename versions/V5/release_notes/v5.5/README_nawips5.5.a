			N-AWIPS 5.5.a Patch Release Notes
				4/24/00	

Patch 5.5.a covers development from March 22 to April 21, 2000.  

************************************************************************

IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTES:

Patch 5.5.a is being delivered as a complete new version.  We are providing
the entire source tree.  Therefore, the entire system MUST be compiled and 
linked.

We have improved the performance of building NAWIPS by setting up
permanent links for the FORTRAN include files.  

You MUST do the following:

1. Modify your .cshrc and/or .profile files by adding -I$GEMINC to the 
   following compiler flags:

	CFLAGS
	ANSI_CFLAGS
	FFLAGS

2. Add -I$GEMINC/$OS to FFLAGS

3. Add the -s option to the LDFLAGS variable to strip the executables.

4. Set up the permanent links before compiling by executing the following
   script in your nawips account:

	$GEMPAK/install/create_links

We have included .cshrc_5.5.a and .profile_5.5.a as guidance.

I. Product Generation Changes

    A. New NMAP Functions 

	1. New Watch Products

	   The initial WOU and AWN are automatically created in NMAP when
	   the watch is saved.  The PWN text product has been added
	   to the SPCTXT program.
	

    B. NMAP Product Generation Improvements

	1. CCFP Product Generation Function

		a. Modified the CCFP popup to have both issue and valid
	           time pulldowns.  These times are added to the output 
		   text file.  The issue and valid times are now table
	           driven.  Edit the table $GEMTBL/pgen/ccfp.tbl to modify
	           the list of available issue and valid times. 
	   
	   	b. Added the ability to place the CCFP text box and rotate 
		   the direction arrow when creating the product.  
		   
		c. Changed the direction to be towards instead from the 
		   compass point.  
		   
		d. The line type of CCFP was modified to include only
		   the location information in the text product.  
		   
		e. The CCFP is now displayed as group when deleting.

	2. International SIGMET Product Change

	   Added AFOS and WMO headers for the international SIGMET
	   product at the request of the AWC.

	3. Outlook Label Improvement

	   Outlook labels are now table driven.  Labels can be added
	   or modified by editing the tables, $GEMTBL/pgen/grptyp.tbl
	   and $GEMTBL/pgen/outlook.tbl 

	4. Larger Text Size
	
	   Added a larger text size, "Giant" at the request of the TPC.
	   "Giant" now appears as one of the choices in the "Size" popup.

	5. Increased maximum number of VG File Elements

	   The maximum number of elements in a VG file was increased to
	   5000 at the request of the TPC.

	6. Surface Prog Product Modification

	   The coding of LOWS has been changed when they are labeled
	   with "XX".  For this case, the pressure value is listed
	   as 0000 in the text product.  This was done at the request
	   of the HPC.

	7. Hurricane Track Product Improvements

	   Added a pop-up window to the hurricane track product function.
	   The pop-up allows specification of storm ID, ocean, issuing 
	   center, date and cycle time.

	8. Watch Status Product

	   Added a forecaster pulldown menu to the Watch Status product.
	   Removed the "CONTINUE WW" and modified the date format for
	   the text product at the request of the SPC.


II. NMAP Display Improvements	

    A. Seek/Locator Functions

	1. Made the "Seek Results" text fonts uniform.

	2. The "Seek Results" scroll list is cleared out when input 
	   is invalid.

	3. Added error checking for invalid entries.

	4. More complete station names are now shown in the GUI.
	   Up to 15 characters are now displayed. 


    B. Improved Cloud Height Function

	1. The cursor type now changes from an + to an x when the 
	   function is calculating the height.

	2. The distance units are now consistent between distance and
	   maximum search radius entries in the "CLOUD HEIGHT OPTIONS
	   GUI".

	3. The function automatically uses the moist adiabatic method
	   if the standard method cannot determine a cloud height.

	4. The user can specify whether multiple or single cloud height 
	   values are displayed.

	5. A "Status Message" text box has been added to the "CLOUD
	   HEIGHT" GUI to indicate whether the moist adiabatic method
	   has been substituted for the standard method.  If both
	   methods fail to find a cloud height, then status message
	   will provide information indicating why no cloud height could be 
	   calculated.  It also indicates whether multiple cloud heights 
	   have been found when the single level option has been selected.  

	6. Cloud height is now calculated for a stable sounding.  
	   In this case, the status message will display "Stable sounding".

	7. Cloud height defaults are now table-driven.  They are specified
	   in the table: $GEMTBL/nmap/nmap_cldhgt.tbl.

	8. Zero height is displayed if the cloud temperature is warmer than
	   the sounding.

    C. Test Event Decoding and Display

       TEST events for watches, warnings, international SIGMETs and hurricane
       tracks are now distinguished from normal events.  For TEST reports, 
       bounded areas are shown with a dashed line, markers are open rather than
       filled, and point events (e.g., tropical depression), have a "T" 
       displayed next to the event symbol.

    D. CLDS parameter added to NMAP/NMAP2

       The parameter CLDS was added to the METAR parameter display list
       for NMAP/NMAP2 at the request of the AWC.
	

III. NMAP Bug Corrections

    A. Watch Select

       Corrected problem with deselecting and selecting a watch.  The
       watch can now be selected by just clicking on it after it has
       been deselected.

    B. Add/Remove Counties in Roam 

       Corrected problem where the wrong county was added/removed
       when in the roam mode.  

    C. Graph-To-Grid

       Program GRPHGD now properly handles errors where the grid
       file cannot be created.  Also fixed the fatal error when
       more than 2 entries were added to the table:
       
       $GEMTBL/grphgd/grphgd.tbl

    D. Fatal Error with Map Selection

       Corrected fatal error that occurred when changing the map or
       zooming from the "Map Selection" window while looping frames 
       in the main window.



IV. Decoder Improvements

    A. Marine and Synoptic Decoders

       The marine and synoptic decoders were modified to store the 
       undecoded reports.  These reports can be displayed by using
       the GEMPAK TEXT parameter.

    B. METAR Decoder
      
       Modified the METAR decoder to handle April 1, 2000 format change
       of mean sea level pressure from the remarks section of Mexican
       reports.

    C. Aircraft Decoder

       Modified the aircraft decoder, DCACFT to decode more formats of
       turbulence data reported in AIREPS and PIREPS at the request of
       the AWC.

    D. International Sigmet Decoder

       Added the decoding of Volcanic Ash reports excluding the EGGY
       and RJAA SIGMETS.

V. General Bug Corrections

    A. NAGRIB

       Fixed a bug reported by the SPC where the RFC 24-hour
       rainfall accumulation grid was writing the incorrect
       time to the GEMPAK file.

    B. AWIPS Redbook Graphics Display

       Fixed a bug reported by Unidata which was causing an infinite
       loop in some cases.


VI. Known Problems

    A.  Auto-update 

        Auto-update occasionally fails to properly update when the skip 
        factor is greater than one.

    B.  Seek Function

	1. The Seek function does not display the ghost markers and line when
           roaming.  Click on the "Seek Results" window to make these features
           reappear after roaming.  Also, if the data set or map background is 
           changed, the seek function exits.  Click on the seek function 
	   icon to restore its current settings.

	2. The seek function does not locate the county if an independent city
           of the same name exists in the county's state.  The seek function
           finds the independent city instead.


VII. Calling Sequence Changes

    A. $GEMPAK/source/bridge/ma/mawgem.f
    B. $GEMPAK/source/cgemlib/ctb/ctbfszxvl.c
    C. $GEMPAK/source/bridge/is/ismov.f
    D. $GEMPAK/source/gemlib/dg/dgmfil.f
    E. $GEMPAK/source/gemlib/gr/grlist.f


See the nawips.log and changes.log for additional details concerning
these routines.


VIII. Table Format Changes

    A. $GEMTBL/pgen/grptyp.tbl
       
       Added label choices for FRONT, OUTLOOK and LABEL group types.


IX. NMAP2: Evaluation Version:

**** NOTE THAT NMAP2 SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CREATE OPERATIONAL PRODUCTS. ****  

NMAP2 continues to be made available to obtain user feedback.  Many 
bug corrections and improvements have been made in response to user 
feedback and CDB testing.

    A. NMAP functions NOT implemented in NMAP2

	1. The "stop" function is not implemented.

	2. Default data set selections for specific types, e.g, satellite
	   data are not implemented in NMAP2.

	3. Removed the "wipe" button that erased all frames in all loops.
	   This function will be modified to just erase the currently
	   viewed loop in a future release.
	

    B. NMAP2 Bug Corrections

	1.  Fixed problems with multiple projections and loops.

	2.  Fixed problems with auto-update while looping.


    C. NMAP2 Improvements

	1. The loop being viewed is now linked with the loop being
	   selected in the "Data Selection Window"

	2. The loop selected to view is loaded first.  All other loops
	   are then loaded in the background.

	3. The symbol, line, and arrow attributes can now be edited
	   for miscellaneous data types, i.e., WTCH, WARN, HRCN, 
	   ISIG and LTNG.


    D. NMAP2 Known Bugs

	1. The time line does not properly update with non-image data 
	   types.

The necessary compiling and linking instructions are contained in
the following file:

	patch_build_5.5.a 

To execute the script and save its output in a file type:

	cd $GEMPAK/build
	patch_build_5.5.a >&! PATCH_$NA_OS & ; tail -f PATCH_$NA_OS

The output of the script will be written to PATCH_$NA_OS.

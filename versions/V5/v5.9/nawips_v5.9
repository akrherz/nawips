DEE=============================================================================

D.   Decode/Display (DECDSP)

D.4.1
1       a  Modify bridge library routine dc_ghdr to check the bulletin date/time
           (ddhhmm) for validity.  The date/time will be checked to ensure that
           the date is between 1 and 31 and the time is between 0000 and 2359,
           inclusive.  DK, (SJ), 10/27/05.

D.4.2
1	a  Modified several decoders to check for an error return from DC_GHDR, 
	   print an error message, and skip the bulletin.  The affected decoders 
	   are DCIDFT, DCWARN, DCWCP and DCFFG.  DK, (SJ), 11/10/05.

D.6
4	a  Created an option for the station plot to report the lowest ceiling
	   METAR data in NMAP2.  ML, (FY), 7/28/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D1.	QuikScat 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D3.1
1	a  Minor modifications were made to the DCMETR decoder to handle changes 
	   to the WMO code form effective Nov. 2, 2005:  allow “NDV” (no 
	   directional variation) to be appended to the 4-digit visibility value;
	   allow “NCD” (no clouds detected) to be used for sky cover for 
	   automated systems;  allow “COR” immediately preceding the station id 
	   to denote a correction.  Bug fix for an invalid substring reference 
	   which only occurred on hpux11.  DK, CM, (SJ), 10/7/05.
D3.2
1	a  The number of METAR special reports which can be stored per hour (as 
	   text strings) in the GEMPAK file is being increased from a maximum of 
	   6 to a maximum of 30.  Because of the way these text reports are 
	   stored, anywhere from 15 specials (at between 81 and 160 characters 
	   each) to 30 specials (at less than or equal to 80 characters each) can
	   now be stored for a station for a given hour.  This is being done at 
	   the request of the SPC.  DK, (SJ), 11/10/05.


D6.	DCFFA
3	a  Fixed the infinite loop in DCFFA when a slash was found but no VTEC 
	   was found.  Fixed incorrect log message of “Invalid time”when the 
           bulletin header did not have “FFA”.  Enhanced some log messages to 
           help identify the bulletin causing the error. FY, (SJ), 5/2/06.
	
D6.2
3	a  Use NMAP2 and GPMAP to display flash flood watches decoded by DC_FFA.  
	   This will be similar to how WSTM data is displayed. CB, (SJ), 5/3/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D8.	DCUAIR
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D10.	TAF decoder

D10.2
3	a  Fixed the bug in the time matching procedure.  Made a calling sequence
	   change to CTB_DTGET.  Added a new column to datatype.tbl for time
	   matching scheme for each source.  MG, (FY), 5/8/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D11.	SCD decoder

D12.1.1
4	a  Installing latest ncepBUFR library (20060131) and adding new
	   dcigdr decoder.  TP, (SJ), 6/28/06.

4	b  Add latest version on ncepBUFR library (20060414).  TP, (SJ), 7/19/06.

D12.1.2
4	a  Added new 'GG' routines to display the miscellaneous Significant wave
	   height and Sea-Surface Height Anomaly (deviation).  TP, (SJ), 7/19/06.

D12.2
4	a  Added the capability to display  WindSAT MGDR-Lite data in GPMAP
	   and NMAP2, in the same way that QuikSCAT data can be displayed now.
	   GM, (SJ), 7/31/06.

D13.3
2	a  Modified functions to allow the user to color code the ensemble cyclone 
	   tracks based on the wind speed at each point of the track. MG, (SJ),
	   2/9/06.

2	b  Made changes to miscset.tbl to correct erroneous entries for wind levels 
	   and colors.  In GG_ENCY changed wind speed to knots. MG, (SJ), 2/17/06.

2	c  Fixed a bug in gg_ency function that caused not plotting markers for tracks 
	   that had only one data point. MG, (SJ), 2/26/06.

D13.4
4	a  Changed the model names in miscset.tbl and also increased the number
	   of models.  To reflect the increased number of models, incresed the
	   parameter NA to 25 in functions GG_NATC, GG_ENCY, and program GPMAP.
	   MG, (TP), 7/17/06.

4	b  Fixed bug in gg_misc caused by increasing NM in gpmap.f.  Verified
	   inputs to incolr.f; could index into 0th array element.  TP, (SJ), 8/2/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D15.4
1	a  Pass location ID ( KZOA or KZNY) through origin varible when origin 
	   ID equals KKCI.  TP, (SJ), 10/14/05.

D16.2
2	a  Fixed a problem where the year was not interpreted properly for
	   drifting buoy data.  The year is encoded as a single digit in the
	   data and the code originally had a window of 1996-2005 for interpreting
	   the value.  This fix removes the window and will work for data from
	   any year.  SC, (SJ), 1/17/06.

2	b  Modified the new year check for drifting buoys for the special case when
	   the bulletin time is in 2009 but the report is for 2010.  This will work
	   for any year ending in 9 with a report for the following year.  CM, (SJ),
	   1/27/06.

D18.2
3	a  Modified subroutine HC_GHDR so that it will recognize either format of the
	   issuance date/time string.  SG, (SJ), 5/22/06.


D22.	??

D22.1
1	a  The WOU decoder, DCWOU was modified to check for the additional case 
	   when there is only one occurrence of TEST..., which could happen when 
	   RESENT or CORRECTION replaces the second TEST string. FY, (SJ), 9/30/05.

D24.1
3	a  Made changes to RD_DCPM to make sure there is no reference to a
	   non-exsisting array member.  SC, MG, (TP), 4/13/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G30.	GEMPAK programs - GUI

G30.2
1	a  HPC Forecasters have requested the ability to save procedures in 
	   NTRANS similar to NMAP2.  This function will allow them to save 
	   settings for models, groups and panel location for multi panel 
	   display.  The NPF functionality use for the most part the spf cgemlib 
	   library functions to read and write from a .npf file.  The opening 
	   loading, a creation of .npf files will be handled with new functions 
	   to handle the new file extension.  A new drop down menu will be added 
	   to the top menu bar with the options to restore or save a procedure.

	   Saved within a Ntrans Procedure File will be the number of rows and 
	   columns that will be displayed for a multipanel display.  The 
	   information for each panel will be written to the file.  This 
	   information will include the the Metafile source name with the model 
	   cycle date and time replaced with a [cycle_date] and [cycle_hour], 
	   respectively.  The column and row location of the panel, the group 
	   name, and whether the source was used to set the ValidTimeSet variable
	   are also saved within the file.  The information to be save within a 
	   .npf file will be stored into a PanelSrc structure when a user loads a
	   model into a panel.   

	   When a user loads a .npf file, the text strings [cycle_date] and 
	   [cycle_hour] within the source name will be replaced with the latest 
	   available cycle date and hour for that model source.  The model used 
	   to set the ValidTimeSet variable (if done at all) will be loaded first
	   with the remaining models loading at the matching times and and time 
	   intervals.  CB, (SJ), 9/16/05.

1	b  Fixed Problems 1 and 2 and Observations 1 and 2.  CB, (SJ), 10/27/05.


G30.5
1	a  Added a blank line to the beginning of printouts from NWX.  This 
	   avoids a printer filter problem on Linux, with files that start with 
	   MM as the first 2 characters.  SJ, (DK), 9/8/05.

G30.6
4	a  Fixed core dump on 64-bit caused by mis-match between long* and int*.
	   TP, (SG), 6/28/06.



G40.1.1
2	a  Fix segmentation fault, im_cbar CSC for radmap.  TP, (SJ), 1/12/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G51.	GEMPAK libraries - GEMLIB 

G51.7.5.1
1	a  Added a complete set of logical functions to the GEMPAK grid 
	   diagnostic code so that all the arithmetic comparisons are allowed and
	   the result is 1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE.  MG, (KB), 9/21/05.

G51.7.5.2
1	a  Added three logical functions to the DF library.  Made changes to 
	   GDPFUN and DGDRIV to allow the new functions to be used.  MG, (KB), 
	   9/21/05.

G51.7.5.3
 1	a  Added a new function ENS_PROB to compute multivariate probabilities 
 	   from ensembles of data.  The function is identical to ENS_SAVG.  
	   MG, (KB), 9/21/05.

G51.7.5.4
1	a  Added new logical functions DF_EQ, DF_NE, DF_NOT and made changes to 
	   function DG_DRIV and to gparm.hl2 to reflect the changes made.  
	   MG, (KB), 9/21/05.

G51.7.6
3	a  These changes fix several problems in descan.f and flmdat.f.
	   Templates with embedded '*' could not be parsed for date-time
	   substitutions.  Single time ensemble files swamped the algorithm
	   that scanned for ensemble members.  Lagged ensemble members were
	   removed as duplicate files for the global ensemble.  All of these
	   problems are fixed.  KB, (DP), 4/7/06.

	b  This change fixes a bug in descan.f that would have caused templates
	   of the form YYMMDDHH to be filled incorrectly.  This changes adds
	   elements to the data type table file to separately address components
	   of the SREF.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

G51.8
1	a  Added four new grid functions.  DF_IGPT/DF_JGPT return I/J points of 
	   the grid indices.  DF_SGMX/DF_SGMN set the grid max/min at every grid 
	   point.  TL, (KB), 10/25/05.

G51.11.1
3	a  New Layer Diagnostic Function accessed via GFUNC or GDPFUN:  lyr_mxmn.
	   LH, (SJ), 5/03/06.

3	b  These changes fix some bugs and features found in the original delivery.
	   The most severe bug, specifying the wrong spelling for a function keyword 
	   entry, results in a segmentation fault.  Other problems include incorrect 
	   arguments passed to DL_LVLS so that LAV functions would fail, unnecessary 
	   call to DG_QLYR, and inefficient assignment of the output grid in some 
	   cases. KB, (SJ), 5/9/06.

G51.11.2
3	a  New Layer Diagnostic Function accessed via GFUNC or GDPFUN:  lyr_fvonisfc.
	   LH, (SJ), 5/03/06.

	   RT, (DP), 12/30/05.

2	b  Pull back to v591 for the following functions. Only DESCAN.F has been 
	   changed since delivery. The change is made by Mike, for changing the 
	   template string length to MXTMPL. I incorporated those changes. RT,
	   (SJ), 2/23/06.

G51.14
1	a  The HPC found a bug when the 6-hour precipitation at F12 from the NAM 
	   is used inside an Ensemble diagnostic.  The problem has now been fixed
	   in the precipitation accumulation function.  SJ, (DP), 9/20/05.

G51.15
2       a  Created a new parameter for the length of the data file name template
           and made chage to the affected common files and functions.  Also,
           changed the format of datatype.tbl.  MG, (SJ), 1/27/06.

G51.16
3	a  Added functions GG_WACT and GG_WFPS to TESTGG program.  MG, (FY),
	   3/17/06.

3	b  Added another prompt for GG_WACT.  Made minor changes to user defined
	   time string in call to both functions.  MG, (FY), 3/27/06.

G51.17
3	a  Made changes to function GH_PUHD so it will skip the storm ID in the
	   advisory header that will be included in the future.  MG, (SG), 4/7/06.

G51.18
3	a  Increased buff length in ctb_dtrd to fix bug caused by G51.15!  TP,
	   (SJ), 3/27/06.

G51.19
3	a  Modified $GEMPAK/source/gemlib/vf/vfcnsel.c to remove the forecaster
	   name from the SEL-cancel product.  GG, (FY), 4/4/06.

G51.20
3	a  Increase the size of a global variable INGLEV in DGCMN from 20 to LLMXLN.
	   RT, (DP), 4/7/06.

G51.21
4	a  Added ST_NULL to nmap_dslw.c, nmap_spfw.c, and mod_snd.c.
	   Simplified st_null.  TP, (SJ), 7/27/06.

G51.22
4	a  Fixed the bug reported by the SPC when the SEL product for watch
	   #281 was issued at midnight, but was disseminated incompletely.
	   Replace “MIDNIGHT” in the date/time line of the Mass News
	   Dissemination (MND) header with 1200 AM in both the SEL regular
	   and cancel.  HZ, (FY), 6/29/06.

G51.23
4	a  Fixed No Union Display problem for Watch 579 in NMAP2.  ML, (FY), 7/17/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G52.	GEMPAK libraries - CGEMLIB 

G52.13
1	a  The SPC reported a bug where the Watch Status Message contained both 
	   the “DIST DIR STN” and “LAT LON” format for the points on the line.  
	   The WSM not contain lat/lon values.  This delivery fixes the format 
	   problem.  SJ, (DP), 9/20/05.

	   HPC called with the same bug at 9pm on Sat 03/04/06. NMAP2 crashed
	   when the Excessive Rainfall product was created. Found that setting
	   the lat/lon for closed lines was taking the arrays out-of-bounds.
	   Fixed by setting the duplicate point to subscript "npts-1".
	   SJ, (SJ), 3/5/06.

	   then middle click, nmap2 crashes).  BY, (ES), 8/3/06.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.13.15  Formatter upgrades

8.13.15.5
1	a  Added processing to the GFA text formatter to process IFR CIG and IFR 
	   VIS combination.  Also moved function pggfaw_cmpSeverity to cgemlib as
	   ctb_gfaCmpSeverity.  JW, (DP), 10/20/05.

8.13.15.6
3b	a  Format changes to the airmet text bulletins to place status from the
	   outlooks into the airmet header and in the outlook paragraphs.  Also
	   add periods after each conditions statement.  ES, (SJ), 6/21/06.

3b	b  Fixes to problem 1 from test report.  ES, (DP), 6/23/06.

8.13.15.7
3	a  Implemented AIRMET wording depending on snapshot information.  JW, 
	   (DP), 4/12/06.

3	b  Fixed two seg faults, revised airmet xml structure, updated airmet 
	   schema, modified the airmet stylesheets to include conditions related
	   information. ES, (DP), 4/18/06.

3	c  Fixed some problems reported by AWC.  BY, (DP), 5/5/06.

8.13.15.8
2	a  Moved pgsmear_findSnapPt(...) to clo_snapPt(...) and added a new 
	   function verifySnapPtOutside(...) to make sure the smeared GFAs are 
	   never smaller than snapshots.  BY, (DP), 12/14/05.

8.13.15.9
3	a  This release implements a MT_OBSC state inclusion list table.  The
	   airmet formatter code now uses this state list for MT_OBSC hazards
	   in the Sierra Airmet in order that the state lists will include only
	   those states that are in the inclusion list.  This inclusion list
	   does not affect the From line of Sierra airmets.  It will only affect
	   the MT_OBSC airmet's state list in a similar fashion to the current
	   practice of excluding the Great Lakes and Coastal Waters from the
	   MT_OBSC state list without altering the From line.  If a state list
	   is found to be empty of all states after this check (e.g., the smear
	   is over the Dakotas), then no airmet will be created.  This list is
	   contained in an xml table, along with a new routine which provides a
	   generic way to read any table that is an xml document.  ES, (SJ), 4/28/06.

3	b  This release fixes a problem with the MT_OBSC state exclusion list.  
	   Mike G. found that the state list wasn't getting purged for those states
 	   in the adjacent Area.  This is now fixed.  ES, (DP), 5/16/06.


8.13.15.10
2	a  Added TURB-HI and TURB-LO into the GFA hazards.  BY, (DP), 2/8/06.

8.13.15.11
3	a  Introduced the snapshots information into the airmet formatter for
	   future projects.  JW, (DP), 3/13/06.

3	b  Fixed a crash that occurs when there is a FZLVL contour of forecast
	   time 0-6 and a second of time “0”, “3”, or “6” of the same hazard type.
	   Problem is that FZLVLs don't have component smears but the conditions
	   wording code didn't know that.  ES, (DP), 5/17/06.

8.13.15.12
3	a  Added processing of special snapshots to the smear and airmet processing.
	   JW, (ES), 5/5/06.

8.13.15.13
4	a  Fixed the incorrect or incomplete conditional wording for outlooks
	   embedded in the airmet.  JW, (DP), 7/11/06.

8.13.15.14
3	a  Convert the airmet text display to courier font, in order to have
	   non-proportional fonts.  ES, (SJ), 3/13/06.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.13.16

8.13.16.6
1	a  Fixed a bug in the AIRMET formatter - it failed to generate AIRMETS 
	   when a part of the AIRMET polygon (less than 3000 square miles) 
	   crossed into another FA area(s).  JW, (DP), 10/4/05.

8.13.16.7
1	a  This release fixes a boat load of small airmet formatter issues that 
	   the AWC reported in the 9/29 evaluation.  I also took the opportunity 
	   to futher re-organize the formatters in order to increase code reuse.
	   ES, (DP), 10/18/05.

1	b  Fixes for problems 1 and 2.  ES, (SJ), 10/27/05.


8.13.16.8
1	a  Added code to make the initial cycle selection based on current time 
	   in the airmet formatter GUI.  BY, (ES), 10/17/05.

8.13.16.9
3	a  Fixed two bugs found by AWC in the recent test executable package:  
	     1. Airmet sierra is missing the canceled and amended statements in
		the actual airmet paragraphs.
	     2. All airmets are missing the period ending the due_to/flight 
		level line.  If there is anything before the conditions statement
		it should be ended with a period. ES, (SJ), 5/2/06.

3	b  Fixed the missing DUE TO information in Turb airmets in the Tango
	   report, and removed extra “.” from the Tango and Zulu airmets.  ES,
	   (DP), 5/12/06.

8.13.16.10
3b	a  Changed the slash to a space for IFR hazards in the Sierra airmet bulletin.
	   Fixed the missing final point in the closed FZLVL BOUNDED BY line, and
	   fixed the point ordering for the clipped, closed FZLVL contour.  ES,
	   (SJ), 6/21/06.

4	b  Fix slash ('/') location in the IFR hazard (GFA) GUI and in the Sierra
	   text report.  If an IFR hazard (snapshot or smear) contains only CIG
	   conditions, then it should read:  'CIG BLW 010'.  If an IFR hazard
	   (snapshot or smear) contains only one VIS condition then it should
	   read:  'VIS BLW 3SM FG'.  There should be no '/' after the 3SM.  If
	   an IFR hazard( snapshot or smear) contains both CIG and VIS conditions
	   then it should read:  'CIG BLW 010/VIS BLW 3SM FG/BR/PCPN'.  Slash
	   should go between the CIG and VIS phrases, and between the VIS
	   conditions.  There should be no slash after the 3SM.  ES, (SJ), 7/19/06.

8.13.16.11
3c & 4	a  Move international clipping earlier in the processing (first).  Remove
	   test for zero equality in clo_snap and replace with tolerance test
	   when snapping.  (This is due to inaccuracies generated when
	   coordinates are gtrans'd from M to N and back again.)  DP, (ES), 7/21/06.

8.13.20
4	a  afcreate.c changes: 3 bug fixes as described in design section, per
	   AWC evaluations cgrreducepts.c changes: 1 bug fix as described in
	   design section, per AWC evaluations.  DP, (SJ), 7/28/06.

3c	b  Removed Bingfan's changes from afcreate.c.  BY, (SS), 8/1/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.14	Refinements to filtering
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.15	Smear point reduction
8.15.1.1
3	a  Modified the stand-alone program afcreate to check all FROM and
	   BOUNDED BY (outlook) polygons for inclusion of ANY component
	   snapshot.  ML, (DP), 4/5/06.

3	b  Correct design error.  For step 3 the ability to format user-drawn
	   smears is required.  Previous release blocked smear/outlook processing
	   when there were no component snapshots.  This release formats
	   smears/outlooks that have 0 component snapshots.  ES, (SJ), 4/20/06.

8.15.1.2
3	a  Added code to afcreate program to clip all resultant FROM and OTLK
	   lines against an international boundary.  ML, (DP), 4/12/06.

3	b  Clipped points (those points not existing in either the original 
	   polygon or the FA international bound) need to be snapped. ML, (DP),
	   5/2/06.

3	c  Bug fix within the processing for international border clipping. 
	   Points were being converted back to M coords from D via GTRANS and 
	   the resulting inaccuracies produced AIRMETS and OUTLOOKS sometimes 
	   larger than the original smear. DP, (SJ), 5/9/06.

3	d  Bug fix - for mismatching at FA regional boundaries during GFA text
	   formatting.  DP, (ES), 5/11/06.

3	e  Bug fix - for mismatching at FA regional boundaries during GFA text
	   formatting.  DP, (ES), 5/12/06.

3	f  Bug fix - for mismatching at FA regional boundaries during GFA text
	   formatting.  DP, (ES), 5/17/06.


8.15.1.3
3	a  Changes to NMAP GFA smear processing to eliminate clustered points.
	   Calling sequence change to clo_snapPt; reflected in delivered changes
	   to afcreate.  Also, modification to the sparse point processing to
	   prevent NMAP from crash-and-burn when snapshot(s) are drawn outside
	   the FA international boundaries.  These changes are in nmap_pgsmear
	   exclusively.  DP, (SJ), 4/17/06.

3	b  bug fix - since the GFA snap is now changing the number of points in
	   the GFA smear element (also the sparse snap point addition might add
	   one or more points), the number of points being returned in the GFA
	   element may be different.  Several functions were calling the smear
	   function under the assumption that the number of points would not
	   change.  This assumption is now corrected.  DP, (ES), 5/11/06.


8.15.1.5
3	a  Skip FZLVL when smearing GFAs.  BY, (ES), 4/20/06.

3	b  Fix Smear All so that if there are 2 hazards at the end of a sequence
	   (two 0 hrs or 2 at hour 6, etc), the smear doesn't end up with a time
	   of 0-6-6 or 3-3-6.  ES, (DP), 5/15/06.


8.15.1.6
3	a  Make smear issue type the worst case from all component snapshots.
	   ES, (SJ), 5/2/06.

8.15.1.7
3	a  Added a new routine to ctbgfa.c to combine two strings of IFR types, and
	   use this within the Smear tool to ensure IFR smears and outlooks contain
	   all of the IFR types found in their component snapshots. ES, (SJ), 5/2/06

8.15.1.8
4	a  Modified the assignment of GFA issue status to the GFA smear/outlooks
	   based upon new rules provided by the AWC.  BY, (ES), 7/19/06.

8.15.1.9
4	a  Added a capability for the GFA to account for no snapshots in FROM and
	   OUTLOOK FA Areas.  ML, (DP), 7/6/06.

4	b  Fixed a bug of GFA producing only one airmet in the same FA region.
	   ML, (DP), 7/19/06.

8.15.1.10
3b	a  Revert back to ORIGINAL smear algorithm.  DP, (TP), 6/22/06.

8.15.2.6
2	a  Modification to ensure proper rounding of lats and lons in build_snap
	   program.  SD, (DP), 1/11/06.

8.15.2.7
3	a  Modify snapping algorithm to account for sparse snap point regions.
	   Modify the snap algorithm in clo_snapPt to trap situations where a snap
	   point cannot be found.  Return as a snap point a point which is the
	   closest available snap point, but also return a code (in iret) which
	   signals that such a situation has occurred.  The application must then
	   insert this point prior to the original point, then call the snap
	   routine again with the original point.  The net effect will be in add a
	   single point wherever one is needed to adhere to the snap rule which
	   requires the smear to never be smaller than a snapshot.
	   Modify the smear snapping call to check the return code for point insertion.
	   If the insertion code is returned, insert the returned point into the
	   original polygon and call the snap routine again with the same point
	   as before.  This point should now snap appropriately.  DP, (SJ), 4/5/06.

8.15.7
4	a  Added a new mechanism to the Smear GUI to allow users to smear by “tag”.  
	   JW, (ES), 7/6/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

8.22.1
2	a  Added the functions to draw open-line FZLVL.  BY, (ES), 1/3/06.

2	b  Put level string into the text box for GFA FZLVL.  BY, (ES), 1/11/06.

8.22.2.1
2	a  Added a new routine cgr_linepoly into the cgr library.  BY, (ES), 
	   1/24/06.

8.22.2.2
2	a  Added code into afcreate.c to handle open line GFA (FZLVL). BY, (ES),
	   2/6/06.

8.22.2.3
2	a  This release formats the freezing level paragraph of the Zulu airmet 
	   bulletin using freezing level contours that are within or intersect 
	   a given FA.  The freezing level paragraph is formated using information 
	   from both M_FZLVL and FZLVL hazards. ES, (SJ), 2/6/06.

8.22.2.3
3	b  Fixed the seg. fault during the second run. BY, (DP), 2/9/06.

8.22.2.4
2	a  This release snaps the ends of freezing level contours after they are 
	   clipped at the FA bounds when the Zulu airmet bulletin is formatted.
	   ES, (SJ), 2/7/06.

8.22.2.5
3	a  Added several routines to determine the top and base icing levels from
	   an FA area which is not intersected by any FZLVL contours.  BY, (ES),
	   4/3/06.

3	b  Fixed the FZLVL order problem in the test report.  BY, (ES), 4/7/06.

8.22.2.6
3	a  Modify the .xsl files that format the airmet text bulletin to treat a
	   base of '000' in M_FZLVL, Turb, and Ice hazards as 'SFC'.  ES, (SJ),
	   3/13/06.

8.22.2.7
3	a  This release implements an improved point reduction algorithm for FZLVL
	   contours.  It applies a kevlindev algorithm to remove unnecessary points
	   in a (relatively) straight line.  ES, (SJ), 4/24/06.

8.22.2.8
3	a  Modified code to remove short FZLVL sections and gaps when generating 
	   airmet bulletin. 4/18/06.

3	b  Add a check for short gaps in freezing level contours before making the
	   check on whether the end points should be extended to the FA bounds.
	   This fixes a problem Jun found in testing (P8 in his list).
	   ES, (DP), 5/16/06.

3	c  Change to prefs.tbl to make the minimum freezing level contour length
	   and the maximum freezing level contour gap length the same.  If these
	   values are not the same then a given freezing level contour will format
	   differently in adjacent FA Areas.  ES, (DP), 5/18/06.

8.22.2.9
3	a  Fixed the point order bug in the formatted FZLVL contours in the
	   Zulu airmet.  The problem was caused by the From line routine which
	   attempts to re-order the points.  Adjusting one of the input
	   parameters averts the point re-ordering.  ES, (SJ), 3/17/06.

8.22.2.10
3	a  Modified airmet_zulu.xsl to add the appropriate status message to the
	   freezing level paragraph if one or more of the FZLVL contours has an
	   issuance type of amended or corrected.  ES, (SJ), 4/24/06.

3	b  Fixed a problem Jun found with the FZLVL and M_FZLVL in the Zulu airmet.
	   The first line of the airmet was not getting “AMD” or “COR” added if
	   there was a FZLVL or M_FZLVL contour of other than NRML status.
	   ES, (DP), 5/17/06.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.22.3
3	a  Create a new program that generates GFA FZLVLs in VG format from a grid.
	   BY, (DP), 4/13/06.

3	b  Fixed the problem in the test report. BY, (DP), 4/18/06.

8.22.4	
2	a  This release ensures that GFAs of hazard type FZLVL are always drawn 
	   using an arrowed line.  It doesn't matter if the FZLVL is open or 
	   closed, it will always be drawn with an arrowed line. ES, (SJ),
	   2/6/06.

8.22.5
2	a  Fixed the bug when deleting points in an open line FZLVL or moving, 
	   copying. BY, (ES), 2/9/06.

8.22.6
3	a  Added flip support for FZLVL.  BY, (ES), 4/20/06.

8.22.7
4	a  For purposes of formatting airmet Zulu reports, open any closed FZLVL
	   contours that are clipped by an FA Area bound.  ES, (DP), 7/12/06.

8.22.8
4	a  Changed the algorithm used to find freezing level contours outside
	   an FA area.  The new algorithm determines the distance to all the
	   available contours.  It then chooses the closest contour and
	   determines if is to the right or left of the are centroid, and
	   derives the freezing level range accordingly.  ES, (DP), 7/21/06.

8.23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.24.2
1	a  Added OVERWR parameter to a number of functions (NAGRIB, NAGRIB2, 
	   NDFDG2) and help files to allow the user to overwrite the existing 
	   GEMPAK grid files.  MG, (SG), 10/20/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.25.1
1	a  Added support to the GFA GUI to include new forecast hours of “9-9”
	   and “12-12” for users to draw single hour outlooks.  Added support
	   to differentiate between a user drawn outlook and a system generated 
	   outlook.  JW, (ES), 10/11/05.

8.25.2
2	a  This release adds support for outlooks to the airmet bulletins.  If the
	   user's vg file contains outlooks of the appropriate type (TURB, LLWS, 
	   STG_WNDS, ICE, IFR, or MT_OBSC) information about the outlooks will 
	   show up in the formatted airmet bulletin.  ES, (SJ), 12/14/05.

8.25.3
4	a  Added a check on component smear overlaps to OUTLOOK, i. e., the MAYBE
	   condition as to whether an OUTLOOK gets generated or not.  Also fixed
	   a bug for user-drawn smears without associated snapshots.  Originally,
	   such a smear was reported only for one area even if it crossed over
	   two FA areas.  JW, (DP), 7/25/06.


8.25.4
2	a  Include the 6hr snapshot in Outlooks created by the Smear All function.
	   ES, (SJ), 1/27/06.

8.25.5
2	a  Make AWC specified fixes to the format of the outlooks within the
	   airmet text bulletins.  ES, (SJ), 1/24/06.

2	b  This release contains changes to the airmet stylesheets to fix problems 
	   the AWC reported with outlooks.  See the testing instructions for the 
	   exact problem description. ES, (SJ), 2/7/06. 

2	c  This release contains more AWC specified changes to the airmet text 
	   bulletins.  The principle changes were to the format of the outlook.
	   ES, (SJ), 2/10/06.

2	d  This release fixes problem 1 above, as well as another bug I found in
	   testing my fix to 1.  See testing instuctions for more information.
	   ES, (SJ), 2/16/06.

3	e  Fix minor format bug for MT_OBSC and SFC_WND outlooks.  ES, (SJ),
	   3/13/06.

8.25.6
3	a  Fixed a formatter problem with outlooks for MT_OBSC and SFC_WNDS.
	   ES, (SJ), 3/13/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
8.26
1	a  Set the issue time of airmet bulletins according to the type of 
	   airmets included in the bulletin.  HZ, (ES), 9/7/05.

1	b  This release includes required formatter changes as specified in the 
	   AWC's 9/29/05 evaluation of 5.8.4a.  It also includes some new files 
	   which contain reusable templates (roughly equivalent to functions).  
	   These reusable templates are used by all 3 formatters (Sierra, Tango, 
	   and Zulu).  ES, (SJ), 10/11/05.

8.27
2	a  Accounted for merging in GFA smear actions.  Now, if users draw multiple GFA 
	   snapshots  at any single forecast hour or at any discrete hours between 0 to 
	   12,  “Smear ALL” action will first merge (rubberband smear) the snapshots 
	   with the same single forecast hour into single GFAs and then smear 
	   (time-smear) these intermittent GFAs to create final smears and outlooks.
	   JW, (ES), 12/5/05.

2	b  Fixed the problems as reported.  Also allowed point reduction for single 
	   GFA element smearing.  JW, (ES), 12/12/05.

8.28.1
2	a  Clean up the hard-wired GFA  subtype.  BY, (ES), 12/5/05.

8.28.2
2	a  Modified code to allow users control the GFA widths.  BY, (ES), (SJ),
	   1/10/06.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.29.1
1	a  This release changes the flight level value of “FZL” to “FRZLVL” in 
	   the Zulu airmet.  This bug was reported in the 8/25 review from the 
	   AWC.  ES, (SJ), 9/19/05.

8.29.2
1	a  This release changes the format of the airmet sierra bulletin.  If no 
	   IFR hazard is present, but a MT_OBSC is present, then the “NO IFR...” 
	   message will be written as the first paragraph, then all the MT_OBSC 
	   paragraphs will be written.  The AWC specified this as a deficiency 
	   in the 8/25 review.  ES, (SJ), 9/19/05.

1	b  Duplicated the “NoSierra” case and made a case for only mountain 
	   obscuration, “MMtnOnlySierra” in the style sheet for SIERRA AIRMET 
	   formatting.  (Fixes P1.)  SJ, (SS), 9/20/05.

8.29.3
1	a  Made two GFA and airmet text report formatter changes as specified 
	   by the AWC's review and meeting.  HZ, (DP), 9/27/05.

8.29.4
1	a  Implement the AWC's requirement for the CSTL WTRS phrase in the airmet
	   bulletin.  BY, (ES), 11/10/05.

8.29.5
3	a  Updated airmet formatter according to new state list rules for coastal water.
	   ES, (SJ), 3/13/06.

8.29.6
3	a  Re-order zulu airmet bulletin per AWC requirement change.  ES, (SJ),
	   3/13/06.

8.29.7
3	a  Changed word wrapping for the FZLVL section of the Zulu airmet so that
	   the first line of all FZLVL contours and M_FZLVL lines is indented 3
	   spaces and if the lines are too long, wrap them and indent the
	   subsequent lines 6 spaces.  JW, (ES), 4/26/06.

3	b  Fixed the reported problem P1.  JW, (ES), 4/28/06.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.30
1	a  Changes from the AWC to implement passing the selected day from the 
	   airmet formatter window into the resulting airmet bulletin.  Also 
	   included is an AWC change to the maximum airmet bulletin line length 
	   and a change to the airmet file name.  LH, ES, (DP), 10/20/05.

1	b  I missed a table in my initial delivery.  ES, (SJ), 10/21/05.

1	c  This release fixes a problem reported by the AWC in their initial look
	   at 5.8.4b.  Problem is that the fix to provide a default MOD value for
	   severity is to be applied to only TURB and ICE hazards, but it was 
	   getting applied to all hazards.  This release tightens up using the 
	   default MOD value when formatting the xml stream (afcreate.c), and 
	   tightens up two of the formatters to prevent any severity value from 
	   being displayed except for TURB and ICE hazards.  ES, (SJ), 11/8/05.

8.31
2	a  Extended the GFA support for multiple freezing level hazards by adding
	   top and bottom flight levels.  Extracted  information from the multiple
	   freezing level smears and include it in the Zulu airmet bulletin's XML
	   string.  Modidfid the airmet_zulu stylesheet to format the multiple
	   freezing level hazard in the Zulu airmet.  JW, ES, (SJ), 12/22/05.


8.32.1
1	a  These are coding changes made by Larry Hinson at AWC.  I've added 
	   prototype declarations, informational headers, white space, updated 
	   the testctb program and integrated the changes with the latest dev 
	   file versions.  The principle change is the orientation of the gfa GUI
	   to horizontal rather than vertical.  Some AWC changes to the order of 
	   items in the gfa.tbl are included as well.  ES, (SJ), 11/7/05.


8.33
1	a  Generated graphical display of FROM line for AIRMET product.
	   HZ, (DP), 10/03/05.

1	b  Fixed the bugs reported on test report.  HZ, (DP), 10/27/05.

8.34
1	a  Changed the VOR points separator for LLWS text from “TO” to “-”.
	   BY, (ES), 10/14/05.

8.35
1	a  Modified code to combine the “Format” button and the “Save” button in 
	   the airmet formatter GUI.  BY, (ES), 10/18/05.

8.36
1	a  Added code into nmap_pggfaw.c to handle cases when the tag value in 
	   a vg file is not in the gfa.tbl.  BY, (ES), 10/7/05.

8.37
1	a  Added flags for toggling pt reduction and clipping for AIRMET.
	   HZ, (DP), 10/20/05.

1	b  Fixed the problem reported when the clipping is turned off, a report 
	   should not be generated for an FA area if the GFA does not intersect 
	   with it or intersect it but with the intersection area is less than
	   3000 square nautical miles.  JW, (DP), 10/31/05.

8.38
2	a  Implemented the new algorithm applying the GFA FA Region clipping rules.
	   JW, (DP), 12/13/05.

8.39
2	a  Created a new point reduction algorithm on a closed polygon without 
	   reducing the overall size of the polygon.  The points that result in 
	   the least size expansion of the polygon will be reduced first.  Snapped 
	   the intersection points when clipping a GFA against FA region boundaries.  
	   This helps to keep intact the boundaries between  clipped parts from the 
	   same GFA. 2/14/06.

2	b  Fixed a few bugs: (1)free the "origPt"”point without doing this, nmap2 may 
	   crash in certain cases when formatting GFAs. (2) force closed polygons when 
	   calling cgr_intesect() - if not, cgr_intersect cannot find the intersection 
	   point properly when the last segment (the segment from the first point to 
	   the last point in the polygon) intersects with the boundary.  (3) adjust the 
	   tie distance from 0.1 to 0.01 for two points in map coordinate since we keep 
	   two points after the floating point for the FA boundary points' coordinates.
	   JW, (DP), 2/16/06.

8.40
1	a  Removed the priority checks in pgsmear_findSnapPt() to ensure a drawn 
	   point would snap to the closest coordination point or snap point.  
	   Originally, a drawn point outside of 10nm from a coordination point 
	   would snap to the snap point other than the coordination point even 
	   though the coordination point was closer to the drawn point than the 
	   snap point.  JW, (DP), 10/25/05.

1	b  Fixed bug introduced in removing priority checks on potential snap 
	   points.  ES, (DP), 11/4/05.


8.41
1	a  Modify the build_snap program to thin coordination points that are 
	   also VOR points according to the greater of the thinning values.  
	   Previously these points were thinned according to the VOR thinning 
	   value only.  ES, (DP), 10/20/05.

1	b  This release contains a fix for O1 from the test report.  The name 
	   of the executable in the usage output was wrong.  ES, (SJ), 10/25/05.

8.42
1	a  Fix a bug in the airmet Zulu formatter which sometimes caused the 
	   flight level statement to read "BTN BTN" instead of just a single 
	   "BTN".  ES, (SJ), 11/10/05.

8.45
1	a  Fixed a memory related bug in afcreate.c.  BY, (ES), 11/16/05.

8.46
2	a  Fix to airmet Tango stylesheet to ensure TURB is always included
	   in the airmet header.  ES, (SJ), 12/22/05.

8.47
2	a  Fix the state ordering in the airmet bulletins when GFA smears are
	   entirely over water.  In addition to the bug fix, the code that
	   generates the state list was moved to a separate, private routine
	   within afcreate.c.  ES, (SJ), 12/28/05.

8.48
2	a  This release generally* fixes the issue time problem with NEW gfa
	   smears.  ES, (SJ), 12/22/05.

2	b  This release fixes problem O1 in the previous release.  ES, (SJ),
	   1/6/06.

8.49
2	a  Fix the flight level bug the AWC found in the 5.9.2 (dev) test
	   executable.  The flight levels for Turb and Ice smears were not
	   getting into the airmet Tango and Zulu bulletins.  Added one AWC
	   mandated change in flight levels - when the base is "SFC" the output
	   flight level information is "BLW [top]", not "BTN SFC AND [top]".
	   ES, (DP), 1/23/06.

8.50
2	a  Change the state list formatting within the airmet bulletin so that
	   MT_OBSC hazards never include any CSTL WTRS or any of the Great Lakes.
	   ES, (SJ), 1/24/06.

8.51	
2	a  This release allows the gfa to use a null valued entry in its menu 
	   table so that the Turb's DUE_TO menu can have an initial blank entry. 
	   BY, (ES), 2/9/06.

9.	Graph-to-Grid Improvements (G2G)


9.5	Handle categories

9.6

9.8

9.10

9.11
1	a  Added capability to process unlabeled contour lines in G2G per user 
	   definition.  ML, (DP), 10/7/05.

1	b  Added a capability for G2G to include the CATMAP parameter name in 
	   error message when handling unlabeled lines.  ML, (DP), 11/2/05.

1	c  Fixed an error handling problem when G2G was run more than once for 
	   unlabeled lines.  ML, (DP), 11/14/05.

1	d  Bug fix - problem in ggrdinfo where if a contour label could not be decoded 
	   into a value, the number of lines was being incremented anyway and the value 
	   of RMISSD was being assigned.  The points were not read in, however, and the 
	   number of points was not updated, so a line previously in memory was being 
	   used.  The result would be an apparent random 'hole' where a contour line was 
	   previously.  DP, (SJ), 12/1/05.


9.12
1	a  Bug fixes - 1.  Add error processing in GGDRIV.  2.  Add error checking
	   and a call to DG_NEND in the NMAP implementation of G2G.  3.  Only 
	   create line extensions for G2G if the BND parameter is not invoked. 
	   On-demand line extensions will remain available in NMAP.  DP, (SJ), 
	   9/20/05.
	   
9.13
2	a  Added new parameter "GGVGF" to the G2G program which allows users to
	   specify a VGF file as input instead of a '.info' file generated via
	   NMAP.  MG, (DP), 1/3/06.

2	b  Added more info into prologues of ggcrinfo.c and grphgd.txt  files.
	   MG, (DP), 1/6/06.

2	c  In response to the problem found during tests, appropriate corrections
	   for functions pggfmt_setPDF and pggfmt_ipPutv have been made in order to
	   supress the user input for parameter GGVGF when running GRAPH-TO-GRID
	   from NMAP2.  MG, (DP), 1/24/06.

2	d  Fixed a bug, that caused NMAP2 to segfault when trying to create a 
	  “.info”file in the directory where the user doe not have permissions 
	   to write. MG, (DP), 2/23/06.

2	e  Emergency bug fix from G2G using multiple layers.... do not build range
	   records if G2G being called from NMAP.  DP, (SJ), 3/1/06.

TEN=============================================================================

10.	SPC Outlook Product Generation (SPC OTLK)

10.5
3	a  Modified NMAP2 to add a ghost arrowhead on ghost lines for all
	   multi-point, closed and unclosed lines.  Added a flag in prefs.tbl
	   so this feature can be turned on/off.  HZ, (FY), 3/30/06.

10.6
3	a  Added a capability to specify the left-of-line value in DLINES for G2G.
	   ML, (DP), 4/18/06.

3	b  Update help file.  DP, (SJ), 5/9/06.

10.7
3	a  Update dat2pts application to correct an inconsistency with the MND
	   header of the Outlook Points product versus the NWS Directive 10-512.
	   This was noticed by Accuweather and reported to OCWWS, in turn who
	   alerted the SPC.  The d2phdr.f was updated to change: 
	   1040  FORMAT ( 'STORM PREDICTION CENTER...NWS/NCEP...NORMAN OK' )
	   to 1040   FORMAT ( 'NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK' ).  GG,
	   FY, 4/3/06.

10.8
3	a  Increased local string variable, str, to MAX_TEXT.  TP, (DP), 4/17/06.


ELEVEN==========================================================================

11.	Watch-By-County (WBC)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.7	OTE Refinements

11.8.2
2	a  For the county LIST element of an issued WATCH, if the user choose “Off” 
	   for “Clustering” option on LIST attributes window, he/she can only delete 
	   a county but not add it back on.  HZ, (SJ), 12/12/05.


11.15	Add options to WOUPDT to handle more VTEC codes
	

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.16.	Check for non-contiguous cnty inclusion -or- internal cnty exclusuion

11.16.4
1	a  Made“QC Counties toggle button a default on button when“Watch 
	   Specifications and County List”window is popped up the first time.  
	   HZ, (SJ), 11/8/05.

11.16.5	a  Added automatic advisory number insertion. HZ, (DP), 4/19/06.

11.17.  Decode and Display watches 

11.17.20
1	a  The SPC reported a problem where canceled counties were still being 
	   displayed.  This task fixes that problem by modifying the check for a 
	   valid report.  ML, (SJ), 11/9/05.

11.17.21
1	a  Increased the array of county numbers in pglist_updtStatusCntys from 
	   100 to "MAX_CNTY".  This fixes a crash error reported by the SPC when 
	   generating the list of counties from the previous watch information -
	   WOU and WCNs.  SJ, (SS), 11/10/05.

11.17.22
1	a  The SPC reported a problem where a WCN canceled counties, but these counties 
	   were still being displayed for watch #855.  This problem occurred when there
	   were earlier reports from a different originator following the report in the
	   decoded file.  This problem is fixed by adding a check for the bulletin
	   originator when checking for the issue time.  FY, (SJ), 11/17/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.19
1	a  Added the capability of handling nearby WFOs for WCC.  HZ, (FY), 11/16/05.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.27.1
1	a  Fixed a WOUPDT problem in which a WOU was issued with -e flag for a 
	   watch continuing after a WOU was issued for its cancellation.
	   Modified GG_WACT to re-initialize variables ircntm (most recent start 
	   time) for each watch and over (logical for when the user specified 
	   time is past [or over] the stop time) for each WCN report.  FY, (SJ), 
	   11/7/05.

11.27.2
2	a  The problem reported by the SPC in which a blank was in place of Tazewell
	   County for watch #841 in the WOU text generated by WOUPDT has been fixed.
	   Refinements to checking for a marine zone was added to correct this 
	   problem which occurred for any county having a “Z” in the third character
	   position of its name.  FY, (SJ), 12/14/05.

11.27.3
2	a  Fixed problem reported by the SPC in which counties were canceled by 
	   the WCNs, but still remained in the WOUs issued by WOUPDT.  This problem
	   occurred in the following watches:  #851, 11/7; #875, 11/27; #883, 11/28;
	   #888, 12/4; #889, 12/4.  This problem also occurred when issuing status 
	   reports for watch #875 in nmap2.  FY, (SJ), 12/12/05.

11.27.5
2	a  The wrapper routine GG_WFPS that extracts FIPS code returned by GG_WACT
	   was only extracting 5 characters instead of 6.  Six characters are
	   required for marine zones.  This corrects cases where marine zones were
	   erroneously turned off for status for watch numbers 895-897 and 17 and 18.
	   The array index in the call to ST_NUMB was modified from 11:15 to 10:15.
	   SS, (SJ), 1/19/06.

11.27.5.1
2	a  Fixed pglist_updtStatusCntys to handle Marine Zones. FY, (SJ), 2/9/06.

11.27.6
3	a  The SPC reported that WOU-updates generated from the -e flag did not
	   reflect extensions in time issued in WCNs for watches 58 and 78.
	   This problem has been fixed in WOUPDT.  FY, (SJ), 3/22/06.

11.27.7
4	a  Fixed bug in WOUPDT reported by SPC in which watch #458 was prematurely
	   canceled.  This was caused by a WCN issuing an EXT which was rejected
	   by WOUPDT because it had a start time after the issue time and after the
	   time the WOUPDT was run.  WOUPDT has been modified to not reject WCNs
	   (other than NEW or CAN) with start times after issue times as long as the
	   issue times and expiration times are good since WCNs other than NEW of
	   CAN should take effect immediately at issue time.  FY, (SJ), 7/28/06.

11.28
1	a  Removed the old format lat/lon values from the SEL product.  Added the
	   enhanced format for the lat/lon values to the SAW product.  GG, (SJ), 
	   11/10/05.

1	b  Fixed crash on IRIX when formatting a watch.  The SAW production had a 
	   reference to an array element that was out of bounds.  SJ, (DP), 11/16/05.

11.29
2	a  Added non-solid fill pattern to PGEN county fill.  HZ, (FY), 1/6/06.

11.30
2	a  Added capability to toggle entire CWAs on/off to the Watch Specifications 
	   and County List” GUI.  Increased the number for MXSTATES in pgprm.h.
	   Changed the default from QC Counties to“Specifications in Watch 
	   Specifications and County List GUI.  HZ, (FY), 1/8/06.

11.31
2	a  Enhanced cst_wrap to accept any string to wrap at.  Modified all files
	   that call cst_wrap due to CSC.  Properly wrapped Attention line in SPC
	   products using enhanced cst_wrap.  Eliminated compiler warnings by using
	   newly created macro G_DIFF. TP, (SJ), 1/12/06.

2	b  Fixed problems 2, 3, and 4 for task 11.31 and a new word wrap problem:
	   P1—Fixed garbage in hour, zone, and date line in WOU generated by WOUPDT.  
	   P3—Fixed word wrap problems in the attention line of WOU for a replaced
	   watch generated by NMAP2.  P4—Fixed segmentation fault when trying to
	  “Save in the WCC Save”GUI in WBC PGEN.  Fixed new word wrap problem—the
	   attention line generated by WOUPDT was truncated. FY, (SJ), 2/16/06.

11.32
2	a  Fixed discrepancy in the Final Watch Status product's UGC expiration time 
	   in the county section.  The UGC expiration time is now the same as the 
	   UGZ time which is the watch expiration time.  The bug was reported on 
	   12/21/05 by the SPC for watch 897. FY, (SJ), 2/6/06

11.33
2	a  Fixed the bug which is described as follows: Draw a WATCH and select
	   it. Click on 'Toggle Anchor Pts” button and then click on some latlon
	   points within the WATCH to increase the inactive anchor point list. 
	   You will find the display of inactive anchor points list on the “Watch 
	   Specifications and County List” window is truncated.  To fix this, 
	   added the unmanagement and management of -ancPtsLbl. HZ, (FY), 2/15/06

TWELVE==========================================================================

12.	Tropical Cyclone Graphics and Products (TROP PROD)


12.12	Enhancements and Fixes

12.12.10
1	a  Fixed the Florida Keys problem in TCA GUI.  In the previous version, 
	   a TCA segment can have a continental break point and a break point on 
	   Florida Keys (or on Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico).  Although this 
	   type of segment didn't get plotted, they were listed in the TCA GUI 
	   and written to the VG file.  This delivery has fixed the problem.  
	   BY, (SJ), 9/30/05.


12.13

12.14

12.15.1
1	a  Modify the NMAP2 code which creates the TCV (tropical cyclone VTEC) 
	   text message for the TPC by incorporating bug fixes and improvements 
	   noted locally over the course of the 2005 season.  DK, (SJ), 9/19/05.

12.15.2
1	a  At the request of the TPC, modified the code which creates the TCV 
	   (tropical cyclone VTEC) watch/warning message to put counties and 
	   marine zones in separate message segments, to allow Dry Tortugas to be
	   specified as an island, and to pass the storm advisory number to the 
	   routine which formats the message.  Modified breakpoint table to 
	   update some UGCs per TPC's request.  DK, (SJ), 11/4/05.

12.15.3
2	a  Modified vgstruct.h and many (C)GEMLIB routines to change tropical storm 
	   advisory numbers from integers to characters to support intermediate 
	   advisory numbers.  A handful of utility programs were also changed 
	   accordingly.  NMAP2 was changed to recognize and produce breakpoint vgf 
	   files with intermediate advisory numbers for use with various product 
	   generation.  GPTCWW was modified to read the public advisory for the latest 
	   storm information when an intermediate advisory is specified.  Changed 
	   TCACANCEL so that it will check for breakpoint vgf files for possible 
	   intermediate advisories.  SJ, (SJ), 2/7/06.

12.15.4
2	a  Modify the code which creates the tropical cyclone VTEC message (TCV) so 
	   that if a county or zone has more than one event associated with it, and 
	   the events conflict, the correct event will be chosen.  Generally, this 
	   will be the higher priority event.  If, however, a “water” watch/warning 
	   has a higher priority than the adjoining “land” watch/warning, the higher 
	   priority will be used only for the marine zones, not the counties.  DK, 
	   (SJ), 12/12/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12.16
1	a  Removed program GPKGRF and any related tables and files from 
	   GEMPAK/N-AWIPS. ML, (DK), 9/13/05.

12.17
2	a  File nmap_pgtca.c in $GEMPAK/source/nmaplib/pgen was modified to add a new
	   button on the “TCA Attributes” window.  Some callbacks were modified, and
	   new ones added, to support the functionality of the new “Cancel All” button.
	   New members were added to the tcainfo structure in vgstruct.h.  Many
	   routines were modified to set and recognize the new members when accessing
	   TCA elements.  A new routine was written (gh_0bkp) to display a text box
	   containing storm information when there are no current watches/warnings in
	   effect for the storm.  SG, (ES), 1/5/06.

12.18
2	a  Added tropical cyclone forecast/advisories for 2003 – 2005 to the testing
	   directory under new directory tpc/, for use in testing programs GPTCWW
	   and GPTPC and as an aid in creating breakpoint VG files for past storms.
	   DK, (SJ), 12/30/05.

12.19
2	a  Fixed GPTCWW to handle year changeover when creating forecast track point
	   labels.  DK, (SJ), 1/3/06.

12.21
2	a  Changed county codes to zone in the Tropical Cycle VTEC(TCV), and removed 
	   the marine codes.  ML, (SG), 1/9/06.

2	b  Made TPC requested changes to $GEMTBL/stns/tcabkpt.tbl and tcabkpt_ovl.tbl 
	   for 2006 hurricane season: Add Duck, NC 36.24N  -75.76W (official
	   bkpt); Change Currituck Beach Light, NC from "official" to secondary
	   36.38N  -75.83W; Add Card Sound Bridge, FL 25.29N -80.37W (official 
	   bkpt); Change Fort Walton Beach, FL from "official" to secondary 
	   30.41N  -86.62W - Change Keaton Beach, FL from secondary to "official"
	   29.82N  -83.60W. MM/SG, (SG), 2/16/06.

12.22
2	a  Modified subroutine GH_WWTX to append the storm advisory number to the 
	   storm name header line in the TCV product. SG, (SJ), 2/8/06.

2	b  Modified subroutine GH_WWTX to append the storm advisory number to the 
	   storm name header line in the TCV product.  Also added the storm id to 
	   the header. SG, (SJ), 2/15/06.

12.23
3	a  Added a flag to function TI_ELCL to write out local times of 12AM and
	   12PM as “MIDNIGHT” and “NOON” respectively, only if the flag is set to
	   true.  Made changes to TESTTI and GH_WWTX to reflect that change.
	   MG, (SG), 3/13/06.

12.24
3	a  Made changes to functions GH_WWIN and GG_WWLN and to tables to account 
	   for switching WFO ID from EYW to KEY. MG, (SG), 4/18/06.

3	b  Changed KEY back to EYW for airport locations.  Added EYW back to TAF
	   and METAR tables so that they now contain both EYW and KEY.  SG, (SJ),
	   5/17/06.

12.25.1
4	a  Modified some GEMLIB/GH routines to specify CPHC in the legend box
	   when creating a watch/warning graphic for an advisory issued by CPHC.
	   Also, a change was made to always make sure Hawaii is plotted in this
	   case.  Added some Hawaiian Islands to the TCA breakpoint tables, so
	   any watches and warnings can be properly displayed on the graphic.
	   SG, (SJ), 7/28/06.

12.25.2
4	a  Made changes to program GPTPC and some appropriate functions so that
	   it can produce the wind swath graphic, wind speed intensity chart,
	   and the wind speed table for tropical storms in the Central Pacific
	   Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area of responsibility.  MG, (SG), 6/29/06.

4	b  Modified several routines in GEMLIB/GH to recognize whether the
	   associated TCM was issued from NHC or CPHC, and to display the
	   appropriate center in the graphics labels.  In addition, the graphics
	   produced from a CPHC issued advisory will have the date/times
	   displayed in Hawaiian Standard Time (HST).  SG, (SJ), 7/28/06.

12.26
3	a  Added new Boolean argument to pgtca_makeTcaVgFile, and moved callback
	   pgtca_enableCancelCb to the XmNvalueChangedCallback list for widget
	   _txtAdvisoryNum.  SG, (SJ), 3/30/06.

12.27
4	a  Modified routines GH_RDHD and GH_PUHD to check the storm advisory
	   number and remove any extraneous characters.  SG, (SJ), 8/8/06.

THIRTEEN========================================================================

13.	Marine Quality Control Program (CREWSS)

13.4
2	a  Fixed a segmentation fault when requesting a History File in QC
	   program by removing a duplicate fclose(History_File).  TP, (TP), 1/9/06.


FOURTEEN========================================================================

14.	NSHARP ( NSHARP)

14.5
4	a  xwvuid3.c – increased char st[40] to char st[44].  Commented out
	   redundant calls to show_inversion and show_mixheight.  sharp95.h –
	   initialized raob_mod to zero.  xwviv6.c – added check to ensure that
	   the mouse button had been depressed within the sounding canvas (e.g.;
	   raob+mod=1 in position_cursor().  SC, (SS), 6/28/06.

FIFTEEN=========================================================================

15.	National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD)

SIXTEEN=========================================================================

16.	Volcanic Ash Advisory Product (VAA)

16.4
2	a  Changed some wording for formatted VAA text product.  HZ, (DP), 12/5/05.

2	b  Apply the formatted VAA text product change in a way that uses preference 
	   table. RT, (DP), 2/16/06.

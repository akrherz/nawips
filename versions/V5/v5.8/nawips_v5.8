DEE=============================================================================

D.   Decode/Display (DECDSP)

D.2	Generalize check for TEST messages
1	a  Modified decoder DCWTCH to allow a single occurrence of the word
	   "TEST" to flag a tornado or severe tstm watch as being a test watch, 
	   in accordance with SPC format.  DK, (SJ), 9/30/04. 

D.3
3	a  Increased value of parameter MMPARM (maximum number of parameters) 
	   from 40 to 45 to accommodate additional marine surface decoder (dcmsfc)
	   parameters needed for new buoy data.  Changed a few routines where 40 
	   was hardwired to use MMPARM instead.  DK, (SJ), 4/12/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D1.	QuikScat 

D1.1	Fix GPMAP bug for QSCT
1	a  GPMAP could not plot QSCT data when the number of wind intervals, the 
	   number of colors in the first and second list were not equal.  ML, 
	   (FY), 10/19/04.

D1.2
4	a  Added a new option to NMAP2 and GPMAP that will allow the user to plot
	   circles with the wind barbs/arrows for rain-flagged winds when 
	   plotting QSCT data.  SG, (SJ), 7/1/05.

4	b  Added more info to the qsct.hl2 help file.

D1.3
4	a  Added MISC Data Sources, SEAWND and SEAWND_HI, to NMAP2.  SG, (SJ),
	   7/6/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4	a  Wrote a new decoder, DCFFA to decode flash flood watch reports. HZ,
	   (FY), 8/10/05.
	   
4	b  Fixed problem 1 from test report. Fixed decoding of UGC line when 
	   a range of counties is indicated by a > sign. HZ, (SJ), 8/19/05.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D8.	DCUAIR
	
D8.1
4	a  Modified several functions and added a new one to make use of LST WND 
	   parameter in decoding dropsonde data with decoder DCUAIR.  This will 
	   allow a close-to-the-surface wind to be used as the surface wind if 
	   the surface wind is missing in the raw report.  MG, (DK), 7/15/05.

D8.2
2	a  The upper air decoder DCUAIR was not correctly decoding the 925mb
	   height group when the observed value of the height exceeded 999 
	   meters.  The decoder is being modified to check for this case and
	   map the height to a valid range of 200 to 1199 meters for 925mb.
	   This change will NOT be applied to dropsondes.  DK, (SJ), 2/8/05.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D10.	TAF decoder

    D10.1
1	a  Modified the TAF (terminal aerodrome forecast) decode and display
	   software and tables so that CB and TCU information included in the TAF
	   cloud group can be displayed as cloud symbols CSYL (already existing) 
	   and TCSL (new) in NMAP2.  Modified SFMAP and SFGRAM to allow display 
	   of new TAF cloud symbol TCSL.  DK, (SJ), 11/4/04.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D11.	SCD decoder

    D11.1
1	a  Removed hardwired check on bulletin headers in SCD decoder, which
	   prevented some valid SCD reports from being decoded following the
	   comms id changes earlier in November.  DK, (SJ), 11/23/04.

    D11.2
2	a  Modified NMAP2 display of SCD (Supplemental Climatological Data) to 
	   correct some errors in parameter specifications.  DK, (SJ), 12/14/04.

D13.1
3	a  Added the capability to decode and display the ensemble cyclone tracks
	   generated by various forecast models in GPMAP and NMAP2.  MG, (DK), 
	   4/27/05.

3	b  Fixed gg routines so they would identify the correct ensemble cyclone 
	   track files when hour (in current time or set time) is not a multiple 
	   of six.  DK, (SJ), 5/12/05.

3	c  Fixed bug in plotting ATCF data by removing the NULL added to the 
	   alias name.  SJ, (DK), 5/19/05.

D13.2
4	a  Changed GG_ENCY, which reads, decodes, and plots ensemble cyclone 
	   track data, so that it will work correctly regardless of the order in 
	   which data is stored in the file.  Changed datatype.tbl to reflect the
	   way the data is actually stored in $SPDATA/enstrack.  MG, DK, (SJ), 
	   6/27/05.


D15.1
4	a  Fixed a bug in display of AIRMETs in NMAP2 and GPMAP so that corrected
	   and canceled AIRMETS would display at the right times.  In decoder 
	   DCAIRM, changed sequencing of 'NEW' AIRMETs in amendments to allow for
	   proper matching of amended/corrected/canceled AIRMETs with the 
	   originals.  DK, (SJ), 8/2/05.

D15.2
3	a  Changes were made to several functions used by the GEMPAK decoders 
	   DCAIRM, DCISIG and DCNCON.  These modifications will enable the 
	   decoders to decode, respectively, AIRMET, international SIGMET and 
	   non-convective SIGMET products which contain the new WMO headers and 
	   AWIPS identifiers scheduled for implementation on May 17, 2005 and 
	   outlined in the NWS Request for Change Form dated December 17, 2004.
	   Changes to the software allow decoding of products containing either 
	   the old headers and identifiers or the new ones.  JL, (SJ), 4/21/05.

D15.3
4	a  The GEMPAK decoder DCAIRM has been changed to use the FAA region 
	   identifier instead of the WMO originator when constructing the unique 
	   identifier field of the decoded product.  The region designators are 
	   BOS, MIA, CHI, DFW, SLC and SFO.  (The WMO originator was recently 
	   changed so that it is now KKCI for all regions, making it unsuitable 
	   for creating a unique region-based id.)  JL, (DK), 6/1/05.


D16.1
3	a  Modified the marine surface decoder DCMSFC to decode five new section 
	   5 ("national practice") buoy/CMAN parameters - highest one-minute mean
	   wind speed (PKWS), direction of one-minute peak wind (PKWD), time of 
	   one-minute peak wind (PKWT), lowest one-minute average pressure (PMN1),
	   and time of one-minute pressure (PMNT).  Modified tables to allow for 
	   display in NMAP2 and SF programs.  DK, (SJ), 4/25/05.

D17.1
4	a  Made changes to several functions so GFSXMOS decoder would be able to 
	   decode 12Z data, scheduled to be added on Sept. 13, 2005.  MG, (DK), 
	   7/19/05.

D18.1
4	a  Made changes in functions HC_DECD and HC_FVLD for decoder DCHRCN, to 
	   fix a bug that led to incorrect decoding of JTWC hurricane bulletins.
	   MG, (DK), 7/25/05.

D19.1
4	a  Bug fix - modified aircraft decoder DCACFT for PIREP reports to 
	   recognize a blank as a separator for a range of icing or turbulence 
	   values (e.g., LGT MOD).  [Note – the AWC decided, at least for now, 
	   not to implement part (2) of the above design.]  DK, (DP), 8/2/05.


GEE=============================================================================

G.   GEMPAK

G10.1
4	a  Fixed calling GTEXT with a constant.  TP, (SJ), 7/7/05.

G20.	GEMPAK programs 
	
G20.2
1	a  Fixed bug found by UCAR where panel box is drawn BEFORE a call to 
	   GCLEAR.  TP, (SJ), 10/15/04.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G21.	GEMPAK programs - DC

G22.	GEMPAK programs - GD

G22.1
4	a  Removes the data gap checking so grid fields will be connected at each 
	   data point as long as data exist. TL, (DP), 8/3/05.

G22.3
4	a  Added call to subroutine GD_RDAT (and other supporting routines) 
	   before the call to DG_GRID so that GDGRIB will always try to read 
	   directly from the grid file first.  Added an IF test to call DG_GRID, 
	   if GD_RDAT was unsuccessful.  SG, (SJ), 6/7/05.

G22.4
4	a  Modified the plotting of grid point values to allow for the WAFS 
	   temperature format.  This format puts a plus sign in front of positive
	   values and no sign for negative values.  This was implemented by 
	   adding a format flag to the POSN program parameter after a slash.  If 
	   the flag has a value of WAFT, then the new format is used.  RJ, SJ, 
	   (DK), 8/2/05.

4	b  Added help files to describe the new format flag for the POSN parameter.
	   SJ, (SJ), 8/15/05.

	   tables.  HZ, (AH), 2/8/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G25.2
4	a  Added four new parameters GDATTIM, GFUNC, GLEVEL, and GVCORD into the 
	   OABSFC program.  BY, (DP), 7/13/05.

4	b  Fixed help file for OABSFC, corrected time in example from 050610F006 
	   to 050610/000F006. Made sure GDATTIM has the same number of times as 
	   DATTIM. Allowed different formats for forecast hour, i.e., F06 and 
	   F006 in addition to F6. BY, (DP), 8/10/05.

4	c  Use DATTIM as default when GDATTIM is blank. BY, (DP), 8/17/05.

G26.	GEMPAK programs - SF
	
G26.1
2	a  Increased the character string length of 'witnes' from 20 to 100.
	   AH, (SJ), 12/29/04.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G28.	GEMPAK programs - UTIL
	
    G28.1
1	a  CLIPVGF is modified to work on JET elements.
	    
1	b  Fixed problem reported in testing (P1).  RT, (SJ), 11/12/04.

    G28.2
2	a  Added the utility program SPENES to create the standard parts of 
	   the Satellite Precipitation Estimate product.  SJ, (DP), 2/15/05.

    G28.3
3	a  Made changes to the SPENES product creation program based on 
	   feedback from the NESDIS lead forecaster.  SJ, (DK), 3/14/05.

    G28.4
3	a  Increased the size of the buffer arrays in tag2vgf and vgf2tag.  Added
	   checks for lines with zero points.  Added a check for a line feed 
	   character (CHLF), in addition to a carriage return (CHCR), for 
	   multiple line text.  SJ, (DP), 5/9/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G30.	GEMPAK programs - GUI

G30.1
1	a  Replaced hardcoded 80 with MAX_FRAME_GROUP.  TP, (SJ), 10/18/04.

G30.3
3	a  Added the ability to display raw sounding data to NWX.  TP, (SJ), 
	   4/18/05.

G30.4
3	a  Fixed a bug in function strccpy().  When a path name contains a 
	   character '.', it will not be treated as the character that separates 
	   the suffix from the file name.  RT, (SJ), 4/19/05.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G51.	GEMPAK libraries - GEMLIB 
	
G51.1
2	a  The changes will allow user defined grids to be accessed by function 
	   name only.  Within the functions dg_fnds and dg_fndv, the IF statement
	   will match the input grid with an internal grid if the savflg is true 
	   and the grid name is the same or if the grid name matches along with 
	   the gdattim, gvcord, and glevel parameters specified at input.  CB, 
	   (KB), 12/22/04.

2	b  Update the gparm.hl2 file to provide proper instructions to the user 
	   on the //name feature in GFUNC/GDPFUN.  CB, (KB), 1/28/05.

2	c  Modified gparm.hl2 to reflect how internal grid management treats
	   saved grids.  KB, (SJ), 2/4/05.


G51.2
2	a  Remove leading spaces from file name when using SAVE and RESTORE
	   commands in the gempak programs.  AH, (SJ), 1/3/05.

G51.3
2	a  Fixed subscript out of range error by adding a check on the 
	   subscript.  TP, (SJ), 12/29/04.

G51.4
2	a  Modified routine ti_tzdf to include Atlantic Standard Time as an 
	   accepted time zone for conversion between time zones.  DK, (SJ), 
	   1/24/05.

G51.5
2	a  Added title, mask, and optional legend support to gg_scal.  TP, (SJ), 
	   1/19/05.

2	b  Fixed problem #1.  Moved drawing of units outside of legend if check. 
	   It should always be drawn.  TP, (SJ), 2/11/05.

G51.6
3	a  Added three ensemble diagnostic functions, ENS_VAVG, ENS_VSPRD and 
	   ENS_SSPRD.  TL, (KB), 4/14/05.

3	b  Freed unneeded internal grids in DE_ functions.  Update help 
	   information regarding entering grid time stamps in GDATTIM and GDFILE.
	   TL, (KB), 4/29/05.

G51.7.1
4	a  Three new ensemble functions, ENS_SMAX, ENS_SMIN, and ENS_SRNG, are 
	   implemented.  ENS_SMAX computes the maximum of its scalar argument 
	   among ensemble members, ENS_SMIN computes the minimum of its scalar 
	   argument among ensemble members, and ENS_SRNG computes the range
	   (subtraction of ENS_SMIN from ENS_SMAX).  RT, (SJ), 6/20/05.

G51.7.2
4	a  Added weighted mean to existing ensemble mean functions.  Added a new 
	   ensemble diagnostic function, ENS_PRCNTL,  to compute user specified 
	   percentile value for a given diagnostic function applied to ensemble 
	   members. The members can also be weighted.  TL, (KB), 7/6/05.


G51.7.3
4	a  Increased LLMDGG from 2304000 to 4000000.  Increased NDGRD from 40 to 
	   80.  TP, (SJ), 6/23/05.

G51.7.4
4	a  Implemented DE_MODE functionality.  DE_MODE computes the mode of the 
	   weighted ensemble distribution, the most frequent value.  RT, (KB), 
	   7/21/05.

4	b  Added help information for ENS_MODE function to gparm.hl2. KB, (KB),
	   8/9/05.

G51.9
3	a  Allow the use of exponential notation for the channel type in 
	   imgtyp.tbl.  SJ, (DP), 5/6/05.

3	b  Added more new images - CAPE/CINH and LIX/PWX - to the imgtyp.tbl.  
	   SJ, (DK), 5/12/05.


G51.10
3	a  Swap the order of conditional check in DG_GROT.  This fixes a bug 
	   reported by Unidata.  RT, (SJ), 5/9/05.

G51.12
4	a  Added missing parameter to the calling sequence of GG_WCCK in the test
	   program, TESTGG.  SJ, (DP), 6/16/05.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G52.	GEMPAK libraries - CGEMLIB 

G52.1
1	a  Added caapability to handle '~' in function css_envr().  RT, (TP), 
	   10/26/04.

G52.2
1	a  Modified the cst_gtag and cst_stag routines to allow for input tag 
	   name parameters to optionally include the '<' '>' delimiters in the 
	   string.  Modified the paramter list for each by adding const modifiers
	   to input parameters that are not changed by the cst_ function (and 
	   should not be changed, but because they are passed by reference, could
	   be without the modifier).  Added a new routine, cst_rmtag() to remove 
	   a tag and associated value from a string.  ES, (SJ), 10/7/04.

G52.3
1	a  Added '+' at the beginning of flight level vertical displacement in 
	   cds_jet.  HZ, (DP), 10/18/04.

G52.4
2	a  Initialized cval.  This is necessitated by the fact that a 'C' routine
	   is returning the value of cval and it does NOT intialize the entire 
	   array as required by FORTRAN.  TP, (SJ), 1/4/05.

G52.5
4	a  Modified the function CLO_TQBND to more fully evaluate all potential 
	   inclusion possibilities making the function test all possible polygons
	   for inclusion, and if more than one tested positive, make a 
	   determination as to which polygon is innermost and return that as the 
	   answer.  MG, (DP), 6/2/05.

4	b  Several, as described above in design section.  DP, (SJ), 6/20/05.

G52.6
3	a  Modified cgrcentroid.c to remove the relationship between the computed
	   area and the actual centroid location.  If the area is zero, now 
	   instead of RMISSD returned for the (x,y) centroid location, a computed
	   (x,y) location is returned based on a linear average of the given 
	   points.  DP, (SJ), 3/24/05.

G52.7
2	a  As above, new function to interpolate open lines.  DP, (SJ),
		1/14/05.

G52.8
4	a  Added a new GEMPAK cgr function to compute the area of a spherical 
	   polygon.  JW, (DP), 6/2/05.

G52.9
4	a  Fixed a bug for CAS file open, close error messages.  (Fixes  12.13:O1)
	   ML, (DK), 6/1/05.

4	b  Fixed segmentation fault on Linux2.4EL in TESTCAS (Problem 1 from 
	   previous test report). Added setting the output file pointer to NULL 
	   after closing the file. This only affects the test program. SJ, (DK),
	   8/17/05.

G52.10
4	a  Fixed problem with processing 4 to 2 digits during post processing 
	   using the uattribd.tbl.  TP, (SJ), 7/6/05.

G52.11
4	a  Created cgr_vectxprod to perform cross product of two three 
	   dimensional vectors.  RT, (DP), 7/18/05.

G52.12
4	a  Added a new cgr_ function cgr_qrol.  RT, (DP), 8/2/05.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G53.	NMAPLIB

2/3	    1a  Removed the check on SCAT_ANL in NGD_TLST.  Updated the entry for
	        GOESSST in datatype.tbl and added an entry, with the appropriate 
		restore files, in mod_res.tbl.  In tracing the problem, other 
		problems were found.  In TESTCTB, a typo was found for item #18 
		(CTB_DTGET) when displaying the data category.  Also, in TESTGD, 
		the input filename size needed to be increased from 72 to 256 to 
		accommodate the full filenames in use on the data server.  SJ, 
		(DP), 3/10/05.

G71.2
4	a  Added a new special line pattern consisting of a double line with hash
	   marks between them for use in the product generation function in NMAP2.
	   In addition, utility program VG2UKA was modified to recognize this new
	   pattern as an indication of an ITCZ.  SG, (SJ), 6/30/05.

G72.2
4	a  Added MSAT/GMS formats.  SC, TP, (DP), 7/6/05.

G90.1
4	a  Increased LLMXPT to 50,000 from 10,000.  TP, (DP), 6/7/05.

4	b  Increased LLMXPT to 80K based upon test report for M1.10.  TP, (SJ),
	   7/20/05.


G90.1.1
4	a  Removed and/or reduced the number of references and/or dependencies to
	   the parameter LLMXPT, in particular, replacing the static allocation 
	   of arrays with dynamic allocations where possible.  JW, (DP), 6/16/05.

P2.	Grouping
	
P2.1
3	a  Added a 'show ungrouped' action to the PGEN  palette.  This will 
	   indicate which elements are not in any group.  This is not an 
	   alternative select mode; display of non-grouped elements is the only

	   action.  JW, (ES), 3/14/05.

P2.2
3	a  This release adds nmap2 help files for the actions Show Un-Grouped,

	   line type (arrow line) and the text wording has changed to reflect a 
	   move toward probabilistic forecasts.  SJ, (ES), 12/14/04.

P6.2
3	a  Generate international SIGMET text products using the new WMO headers 
	   and AWIPS identifiers as outlined in the NWS Request for Change Form 
	   dated December 17, 2004.  Modify the appropriate routine in the NMAP 
	   library so the international SIGMET text product can be built using 
	   either the old headers and identifiers or the new ones.  Modify the 
	   necessary $GEMTBL files to support both conventions.  JL, (DP), 
	   4/15/05.

3	b  Fixed problem #1 above.  TP, (DP), 5/4/05.

P6.3
3	a  Generate international SIGMET text products using the new format for 
	   latitude/longitude coordinates as outlined in Technical Implementation
	   Notice 05xx.  Modify the appropriate routine in the NMAP library so 
	   the international SIGMET text product can be built using either the 
	   old or the new format.  Modify the necessary $GEMTBL files to support 
	   both conventions.  JL, (DP), 4/25/05.


P7.	File Management

P7.1
2	a  This release fixes an OPC reported bug in file open.  When a vg file 
	   is initially opened in PGEN append and replace are now treated in a 
	   similar fashion.  In both cases the file opened now becomes the 
	   default file name for all subsequent saves, and the initial save is 
	   treated as a Save As operation.  ES, (SJ), 1/10/05.

	   CPF as an input.  RT, (SJ), 11/24/04.

2.2.4
2	a  Applies the new time/file management to program GDDIAG, GDOMEG, and 
	   GDGDFC.  GDDIAG is also added two new features.  One feature is to 
	   give it the ability to create the output file on fly if it does not 
	   exist.  Another feature is to output vector grid.  RT, (SJ), 1/28/05.

2.2.5
2	a  This change is for applying the new DG/GD time/file management 
	   scheme to programs GDPLOT2 and NMAP2.  RT, (SJ), 1/10/05.

2	b  Fixed a bug that NMAP2 crashes when loading multiple grid data 
	   and surface data from a SPF file.  RT, (SJ), 1/12/05.

2.2.6
3	a  Bug fix, move call to DG_INTL from grphgd main program to driver 
	   (ggdriv).  Add some calls to ER_WMSG in DG_NWDT.  DP, (SJ), 5/19/05.

2.2.7
3	a  OA programs OABSFC and OABSND are modified to eliminate the 
	   restriction that the first guess grid and the output grid must have 
	   the same navigation.  A new user input is also added to allow user to 
	   specify a guess function instead of using the analyzed parameter.  The
	   GD program GRPHGD and GDCFIL is also modified to apply the current 
	   time/file management.  RT, (SJ), 3/25/05.

3	b  Added error message output in subroutine OA_GFIL in response to test 
	   P1.  Added suggestion to oabsnd.txt and fixed grammatical error in 
	   oabsfc.txt and oabsnd.txt in response to test P3 and P5.  Changed to 
	   the algorithm for time search in response to test P4.  RT, (SJ), 
	   4/15/05.

3	c  Modified oabfil.f, corrected help file oabsfc.txt and oabsnd.txt.
	   RT, (SJ), 4/22/05.

3	d  Updated help files for use of in-line value in GUESFUN.  SJ, (SS),
	   4/26/05.

2.2.8
3	a  Applied new library functions in programs GDEDIT, GDSTAT, GDVINT, and 
	   GDGRIB.  Fixed a bug in GDINFO.  GDINFO delivered in 2.2.9 can not 
	   handle dual time properly.  Fixed a bug in NAGRIB(2).  NAGRIB(2) gives
	   an error message when the output grid file, even created correctly, 
	   does not exist.  RT, (SJ), 4/15/05.

3	b  Fixed problem P1, GDSTAT seg fault when GDOUTF is blank.  RT, (SJ), 
	   5/4/05.

2.2.9
3	a  In order to make the processing of GDATTIM be consistent with other GD
	   progream, GDINFO, GDDELT, GDMOD, and GD2NDFD are modified accordingly.
	   For current version of GDDELT, GDMOD, and GD2NDFD, I am not sure if 
	   alias is allowed for 'gdfile' input.  But now, only actual existing 
	   grid file is allowed for 'gdfile' input.  Also fixed a bug in GD2NDFD.
	   The bug is for grid data with STR projection, program crashes.  RT, i
	   (SJ), 3/31/05.

3	b  Fixed problem #1 - seg fault in GDDELT.  RT, (SJ), 5/4/05.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3
1	a  Give the DG library the ability to remap both scalar and vector 
	   fields from any grid navigation associated with an input file to the 
	   internal grid navigation, thereby permitting arithmetic and other 
	   grid diagnostic operations on grids coming from different models 
	   with different grid navigations.  RT, (KB), 10/27/04.

2.4
3	a  Implemented layer grid diagnostics infrastructure and documentation.
	   Added layer diagnostic function, DLSWTM, which computes the weighted 
	   mean of the grid field through user specified vertical levels in six 
	   (6) coordinates: NONE, PRES, THTA, HGHT, SGMA, and DPTH.  Fixed bugs 
	   in a LV function.  TL, (KB), 3/31/05.

3	b  Disallowed users to specify a layer input in GLEVEL for layer 
	   functions.  TL, (KB), 4/29/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5
2	a  Implemented ensemble grid diagnostics infrastructure and 
	   documentation.  Added ensemble grid diagnostics function, DESAVG, 
	   which computes the linear average of the scalar field for ensemble 
	   numbers.  Fixed several existing bugs in DG functions.  TL, (KB), 
	   2/14/05.

2.6
4	a  Added a check in the horizontal remapping to eliminate points that are
	   off of the grid that is being remapped.  For example if the NAM is 
	   being remapped to the GFS grid, then there are locations on the GFS 
	   grid that are invalid for the NAM grid.  Therefore, these locations 
	   should not be computed from the NAM grid.  SJ, (KB), 6/15/05.


2.11
2	a  Fixed a bug for precipitation accumulation algorithm when GFS data 
	   forecast time crossed F180.  RT, (SJ), 1/10/05.

THREE===========================================================================

3.	GRIB2 (GRIB2)

3.1
2	a  New program, nagrib2, is being added to convert GRIB2 files to GEMPAK
	   files.  To support this new program, a new GRIB2 encoder/decoder 
	   library is also being added.  Two open source libraries are required 
	   to support some of the packing options available in the GRIB2 
	   specification.  These libraries are libpng and libjasper, which 
	   contain codecs for PNG and JPEG2000 image compression, respectively.
	   In addition, some of the NA routines in the nagrib program are now 
	   shared by both nagrib and the new nagrib2, so these common routines 
	   are being moved from the nagrib program directory to the na library 
	   in GEMLIB.  SG, (SJ), 1/26/05.

2	 b  Fixed the nagrib2 main program so that the correct prompt is used for
	    the user input.  This is in response to Item II. 1. in the above Test
	    Resullts.  Modified one routine in program ndfdg2, so that program 
	    could link to routines that were moved from the nagrib program 
	    directory to the $GEMLIB/na directory.  SG, (SJ), 2/8/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3
2	a  Added NAGRIB2 to the scripts for building the program help and pdf 
	   files.  SJ, (TP), 2/9/05.

3.4
4	a  GEMLIB subroutine gb2_vlev was modified; checks were added to see if a
	   level value, or its corresponding scale factor, is indicated as“
	   missing.  The abbreviations for Boudary cloud layer (BCY) and 
	   Convective cloud layer (CCY) were changed to BCLY and CCLY, 
	   respectively, in both GRIB1 and GRIB2 vertical coordinate tables.  
	   This was necessary, since GEMLIB routine LV_CORD does not process 
	   blanks in the vertical coordinate abbreviations.  SG, (SJ), 6/1/05.

FOUR============================================================================

4.	Time Selection Improvements (TIMELINE)

4.3.	Time binning of observational data, esp. PIREP
	
4.3.2.	Add Time Binning to datatype.tbl

4.3.2.1
1	a  Added the time bin hours variable to the datatype.tbl table and made 
	   the subsequent code changes to read the table and data structure.  
	   Replaced call to FL_TMPL with CTB_DTGET call.  Removed fltmpl.f from 
	   the library.  TL, (AH), 9/29/04.

1	b  Correctly handled the return error code when replacing the FL_TMPL 
	   call with CTB_DTGET.  In FL_TMPL, the return code is ALWAYS zero even 
	   the input file does not have a template, while CTB_DTGET will return a
	   negative value.  This rehash ensures that the return code in CTB_DTGET 
	   is local.  TL, (AH), 10/6/04.

1	c  Strip off the null character for the path string and the template 
	   string after they are returned from CTB_DTGET for the FORTRAN 
	   subroutines.  AH, (SJ), 11/15/04.

2	d  Prepended a new parameter to BIN HRS string in datatype.tbl.  Added a 
	   new parameter to CTB Dtinfo structure, modified CTB functions (some 
	   along with calling sequences) and as a result all the functions, which
	   this affected.  MG, (AH), 1/10/05.

		    
4.3.2.2
1	a  Created a button and its respective gui for time binning.  This 
	   selection box will appear on the Data Selection Window, under the 
	   'Turn Source Off' button.  This widget will allow the user to select 
	   the option of binning the data.  If the data are to be binned, the 
	   user may enter in the two text boxes how many hours before the current 
	   time they want binned and how many hours after the current time to 
	   have the data binned.  JW, (AH), 10/14/04.

1	b  Removed the time binning button from the Data Source Selection GUI by 
	   ommented out references to the nmap time binning button.  This code 
	   has been commented out to allow for redesign of it's functionality 
	   with each data source type.  AH, (SJ), 11/9/04,.

2	c  Modified the Data Source GUI by adding the time binning on/off check 
	   box next to the Bin Source button and removed the time binning on/off 
	   radio buttons from the Bin Source GUI.  The availability of the Bin 
	   Source feature is now for all data sources in 4 valid data categories,
	   not just the dominant data source.  JW, (AH), 1/14/05.

4.3.2.3
2	a  Add time binning functionality to NMAP.  TL, TP, (AH), 2/2/05.

4.3.2.3.1
2	a  1. Change the Hours Before text box in the Bin Source widget so that 
	   only positive numbers need to be typed.  2. If negative 'hours before'
	   are used in the datatype.tbl (Eg. ON/-5/2), the 'hours before' will be
	   converted to a positve number before being used.  3. Corrected a 
	   problem where if bin hours was saved to the SPF file, when the SPF
	   file was read backinto the active data structure, the bin hour 
	   information was not being applied to the data.  AH, (SJ), 2/9/05.

4.3.2.3.2
2	a  Update the time binning help file, BinHours.hlp.

4.3.2.4
1	a  Fixed a bug reported by the HPC.  The report stated that the Objective
	   Analysis program, oabsfc, was crashing.  Found that the filename 
	   strings were not declared to be large enough in CTB_DTGET and FL_MFIL.
	   SJ, (DP), 12/10/04.

6.	BUFR (BUFR)

6.2.	Create Preliminary Mid-level (SWM) Messages

6.2.2.	ASCII to BUFR 

6.2.2.1
1	a  Added an ability for BUFRENC to generate mid-level significant weather
	   charts (SWM) in BUFR, similar to the way in which high-level 
	   significant weather charts (SWH) are now being generated in BUFR.  
	   Some clean up of the code and improvements to error processing were 
	   also done.  ML, (DK), 10/14/04.

1	b  Fixed seg. fault and MCLOUD data sets not being converted to BUFR 
	   problems for BUFRENC.  ML, (DK), 10/27/04.

6.2.2.2
1	a  Added BUFR section2 data for SWM areas to program BUFRENC, which 
	   converts an ASCII file to BUFR format for both high level (SWH) and 
	   mid-level (SWM) significant weather charts.  Added BUFR prefs table to
	   provide default values.  Replaced table read routine ctb_rdwou with 
	   ctb_rdprf.  ML, (DK), 11/1/04.

1	b  Fixed problem 1-4, Observation 1, and Suggestion 1 in above test 
	   results.  ML, (DK), 11/17/04.

6.2.3
1	a  Modified program VG2UKA (VG to ASCII conversion for high and mid 
	   level SIGWX charts) to:
	   1) Improve error processing for clouds
	   2) Add TURB (CAT) as a data type for mid level (SWM) charts
	   3) Allow the list element form to be used for the FXYTBL parameter
	   4) Per discussions with UKMET, prefix the data type identifiers used 
	   	in the browsable ASCII file for mid level chart data with the 
		letter “M” for ease of identification
	   5) Per discussions with UKMET, use the new BUFR table 011030 
	        (“extended degree of turbulence”) for mapping turbulence values 
		instead of table 011031 (“degree of turbulence”)
	    Removed obsolete programs SIGWXCNV (replaced by VG2UKA) and SIGBENC 
	    (replaced by BUFRENC).  ML, (DK), 9/29/04.

6.2.4
2	a  Modified programs SIGBUFR and SIGAVGF to decode SWM data for the 
	   aviation SIGWX mid level (SWM) charts, for verification and display 
	   purposes.  ML, (DK), 1/21/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.9
1	a  Added the new version of the MELBUFR library.  Made changes to 
	   the BUFR encoding and decoding routines as necessary to match the
	   changes made in the library.  Updated the build scripts to build 
	   the new version and to turn on the DEBUG and TRACE compile flags.
	   SJ, (DK), 11/4/04.

1	b  Replaced recently delivered BUFR tables B and D for BUFR edition 2, 
	   version 2, with tables used prior to that delivery (reformatting of 
	   prior table B for compatibilty with the new melbufr software was 
	   required).  Problems were found with the content of the recently 
	   delivered tables which prevented decoding of high level SIGWX BUFR 
	   messages created in release 5.7.4 or earlier.  DK, (SJ), 11/30/04.

6.10
1	a  Updated BUFR prefs table for edition 3, version 11 of BUFR.
	   DK, (SJ), 11/8/04.

1	  b  The UKMET (WAFC London) has changed the order of the corner points 
	     used to define the map area in BUFR section 2 for SWM charts.  The 
	     order of our points is being changed correspondingly, to LL, UL, UR,
	     LR.  DK, (SJ), 11/12/04.

6.12.	SIG WX changes

6.12.1
2	a  Added an ability to indicate a “slow front on an aviation SIGWX chart,
	   and convert it from a vg file to the browsable ASCII format using 
	   VG2UKA, or from the browsable ASCII format to a vg file using SIGAVGF.
	   ML, (DK), 12/14/04.

6.12.2
2	a  Modify the bufrprefs.tbl used by program BUFRENC so that the default 
	   text values for section 2 of the BUFR message include the phrase NO 
	   LONDON BACKUP for SWM (mid-level) SIGWX BUFR data for Europe, the 
	   Middle East, and Asia South.  (Manually changing a single entry in the
	   bufrprefs.tbl will allow the AWC to change the contents of section 2 
	   to indicate that SWM BUFR files are being produced in backup mode for 
	   WAFC London.)  DK, (SJ), 2/8/05.

6.12.3
2	a  Modified the SIGWX BUFR encoder program BUFRENC so that the base and 
	   top chart layer heights for data type tropical cyclone, sandstorms and
	   volcanoes (V_T_S) indicate that the data in the BUFR file applies to 
	   both high and mid level SIGWX charts.  ML, (DK), 12/14/04.

6.12.4
2	a  Program VG2UKA is being modified to only process the first field of 
	   the CENTER parameter (the center id), and to ignore any other fields 
	   the user may specify.  The documentation for VG2UKA is being changed 
	   to indicate this.  DK, (SJ), 2/8/05.

6.12.5
3	a  Allowed London (WAFC) as a valid originating center for SIGWX BUFR 
	   messages.  ML, (DK), 3/29/05.


SEVEN===========================================================================

7.	High Seas Marine Forecast Products (HSEAS)

7.1
3	a  Added Ice Edge to map processing programs.  RT, (DP), 4/26/05.


EIGHT===========================================================================

8.	Graphical Forecast for Aviation (GFA)

8.12.1
3	a  Added a routine to check GFA forecast hours.  If the hour is a time 
	   span, set the category to smear or outlook and snap the GFA.  BY, 
	   (ES), 4/6/05.

8.12.2
3	a  Added 'From Line' into the GFA window and removed 'Sigmet Ref' text.  
	   BY, (ES), 4/11/05.

3	b  This release changes the format of the GFA's from line text file name.
	   The file name now includes the TAG number as well as the update number.
	   ES, (DP), 4/28/05.

8.12.3
4	a  Initialize the 'From Line' Text in GFA dialog window.  BY, (ES), 
	   6/1/05.

8.12.4
4	a  Modified code to allow users to create single hour GFA smears.  BY, 
	   (ES), 6/30/05.

4	b  Added 0-0, 3-3 and 6-6 into the filter control.  BY, (ES), 7/18/05.


8.13.	AIRMET product formatter

8.13.1
1	a  Created a new CLO function to accept a list of state, Great 
		Lakes and other abbreviations and return the list in proper 
		order based on information found in FA_Area bounds file.  
		Changed memory allocation from malloc to G_MALLOC.  
		MG, (DP), 10/8/04.

1	b  Fixed the bug with the return code.  MG, (DP), 11/9/04.

8.13.2
1	a  Added STATE meta information to the six FA_AREAs, changed the 
	        name and content of the existing VGF bounds and map files 
	        accordingly.  Modified clo.tbl to include the FA_AREA_BNDS 
	        information.  MG, (DP), 9/28/04.
	    
8.13.3
1	a  Added VGF, bounds and map files for new FA regions.  Modified 
	        clo.tbl to include FA_REGION_BNDS bounds information.  MG, (DP), 
	        9/28/04.

8.13.4
1	a  Created a new module that performs clipping of a polygon against 
		a bounds area.  BY, (DP), 9/30/04.

8.13.5
1	a  Created the airmet bulletin formatter which inlcudes two library 
		routines af_selclip, af_format and a stand-alone program 
		airmet_format.  BY, (DP), 11/19/04.

1	b  Fixed the problems in the test report.  BY, (DP), 11/23/04.

1	c  wrap at 66 columns, point reduction to 20 maximum, and
		FA areas can be in lower case.  BY, (DP), 11/29/04.

2	d  Fixed a bug when the output airmet bulletin text is empty.  
		BY, (DP), 12/14/04.

8.13.6
1	a  Modified the current gfa.tbl and filter.tbl to work together. 
		Provided a new gfa.lpf to work with the tables.  SJ, (SJ), 
		10/12/04.

8.13.7.	GFA element redesign
	    
8.13.7.1
1	a  Removed GFA based AIRMET and non-convective SIGMET from PGEN 
		   and all related icons, checks and actions, in preparation to 
		   redesign the GFA element.  JW, (ES), 9/28/04.

8.13.7.2
1	a  Redesigned the GFA element's internal storage to store all 
		   data attributes except npts/lats/lons as tagged strings.  This
		   change is necessary to make the GFA element as flexible as 
		   possible in order to support many different hazard types and 
		   their widely varying data requirements.  Also removed the 
		   interim structure named GfaFileInfo.  JW, (ES), 11/3/04.

1		b  Fixed the endless loop in TESTCES when listing TCA element 
	           settings as reported above in O2.  JW, (ES), 11/15/04.

1		c  This release adds the following features: 1.  Smear All first 
		   deletes any existing smears on the current level before 
		   smearing again.  2.  Smear is corrected so it does not work 
		   between GFAs of different hazard types.  3.  The range record 
		   for GFAs now considers the text box location.  Refreshes are 
		   vastly improved.  4.  The GFA gui now uses the label Upd 
		   instead of Seq/Upd.  5.  A sanity check on the cvg_freeElPtr()
		   routine has been added.

1		d  This fixes 3 bugs. 1)  Smear all sometimes deletes snapshot 
		   GFA elements instead of smearing.  This was a problem with the
		   initialization of the category value.  2)  Disable filter 
		   hotkeys when filter window is not up.  Bad things happen 
		   without this.  3)  Size of layer buttons has been slightly 
		   increased to better fit some of the default layer name values.
		   ES, (SJ), 12/3/04.

8.13.8
1	a  Wrote new ctb routines to read in and retrieve GFA gui 
	        information from a table gfa_temp.tbl.  BY, (DP), 10/13/04.

1	     b  Changed gfa_temp.tbl to gfa.tbl and removed the original gfa.tbl.
		BY, (DP), 11/23/04.

8.13.9
1	a  Added an arrowed line into GFA display.  HZ, (ES), 10/18/04.

8.13.10
1	a  Modified the GFA GUI.  BY, (DP), 11/8/04.

1	     b  Fixed problems 1-4 and suggestion 1 in the test report.  Added 
		'Other' option in forecast hours and the tag in the text display.
		BY, (DP), 11/15/04.

1	     c  Fixed problems 1-2 and observation 4 in the test report.  BY,
		(DP), 11/18/04.

1	     d  Fixed the bug for the single '/' input in the Top/Bottom field. 
		This delivery also includes the fix Ed did for layers/gfa.  
		BY, (DP), 11/23/04.

8.13.11
2	a  Created GUI for AIRMET formatter in NMAP product generation.
		BY, (DP), 1/13/05.

2	     b  Changed Switch from Linux to XML.  BY, (ES), 2/18/05.


8.13.12
1	a  This release adds a new cgemlib library named xml.  This library 
		contains one routine (more will follow) which provides the 
		mechanism to perform transformations of xml documents using xslt. 
		A testxml program is included as well.  At present this library 
		is only available on linux platforms, owing the the need for 
		libxslt support which is easily available on linux but is an 
		unsettled issue on the other platforms.  ES, (SJ), 10/26/04.

2	     b  Corrected the error code for reporting a bad xslt (stylesheet) 
		file.  The initial release used -2 for both this condition and 
		another potential condition (null pointer for the xml string).  
		This clears that confusion up.  ES, (SJ), 12/14/04.

8.13.13
1	a  This release contains two documents.  One is an xslt stylesheet 
		that can be used to transform an xml document and produce an 
		airmet text report.  The second is an xml schema that defines the 
		format that the xml document must conform to in order to be 
		correctly transformed.  ES, (SJ), 11/18/04.

1	     b  Update to the airmet_tango.xsl stylesheet.  ES, (SJ), 11/24/04.

2	     c  Added support for strong surface winds (STG SFC WNDS in output) 
		to the airmet xslt stylesheet.  ES, (DP), 1/3/05.

8.13.14
1	a  Make sure all tables agree with desired end-to-end scenario for 
		GFA AIRMET production.  DP, (SJ), 11/29/04.

8.13.15  Formatter upgrades

8.13.15.1.	?????
8.13.15.1.1
2	a  This release modifies the GFA GUI to allow multiple
	   sigmet references for any single GFA element.  For smears
	   and interpolation, the new GFA elements will reference all
	   sigmet references of their snapshots.  The GUI has been 
	   modifed to disable the sigmet reference controls for 
	   those hazard types that are not permitted to reference 
	   sigmets.  ES, (SJ), 2/2/05.

8.13.15.1.2
2	a  This release modifies the airmet library in order to 
	   change the interim xml stream.  The RefereToSigmet field 
	   of the GFA is parsed for multiple sigmet references and a
	   separate xml element is created for each reference.  This
	   step is a prerequisite to displaying the sigmet attention
	   line in the airmet report.  This release, by itself, will
	   not present any apparent change to the user or interface.
	   ES, (SJ), 2/4/05.

8.13.15.1.3
2	a  This release enables the tango and sierra airmets to 
	   support multiple sigmet references.  ES, (SJ), 2/7/05.

8.13.15.2
2	a  This release adds an xslt stylesheet to produce SIERRA airmet
	   text reports from a vg file containing smears of type IFR or 
	   MT_OBSC.  ES, (SJ), 1/28/05.

8.13.15.3
3	a  This release adds the Zulu airmet template.  This enables generation 
	   of Zulu airmets from either the standalone airmet_format program or 
	   within pgen.  This version of the Zulu airmet will only include icing 
	   hazards; freezing level or multi-freezing level hazards are not 
	   supported.  This release also modifies the pgen airmet formatter 
	   window so that the report of no hazards is now generated when no 
	   hazards are present for a given center.  Finally, some changes were 
	   made to the Tango airmet template to correct the header omission for 
	   the no hazard report.  ES, (SJ), 3/14/05.

8.13.15.4
3	a  This release increases the width of the airmet formatter window.  
	   ES, (SJ), 4/12/05.

8.13.16
8.13.16.1
3	a  This release fixes one minor bug in the Sierra airmet and corrects the
	   output order of the airmets in both the Sierra and Tango reports.  ES,
	   (SJ), 3/25/05.

3	b  This fixes O1.  The region ID is now followed by 'Z' in all cases.
	   ES, (SJ), 4/1/05.

8.13.16.2
3	a  This release adds the update number to the three airmet formatter 
	   stylesheets.  The formatters now seach for the first instance of smear
	   (of a hazard type that matches the formatter) and uses that update 
	   number to construct the header lines.  ES, (SJ), 3/29/05.

8.13.16.3
4	a  This release adds Great Lakes and the phrase AND CSTL WTRS to the 
	   state list in the airmet text reports.  ES, (DP), 8/4/05.

8.13.16.4
3	a  This delivery makes some small changes to the formatted airmet reports.
	   First, flight levels >= 180 have FL (meaning flight level) prepended to
	   them.  Second the tango airmet will now output LLWS EXP instead of just
	   LLWS at the end of a LLWS airmet.  Last the frequency and severity have
	   been removed for the MT_OBSC type hazard and the IFR hazard now has a 
	   frequency.  ES, (SJ), 4/7/05.

8.13.16.5
3	a  This release adds a check on the airmet's from line which removes all 
	   duplicate, adjacent VOR-relative points.  ES, (SJ), 4/19/05.

8.13.17
4	a  In the airmet formatter window, read cycle times and map the issue 
	   time using a new table. BY, (ES), 8/3/05.

8.13.18
4	a  Changed the validation scheme for GFA flight levels.  BY, (ES), 
	   6/15/05.

4	b  Fixed a fatal problem caused by a clo routine.  Added code to allow 
	   middle button to exit GFA for hazard with empty top/bottom.  BY, (ES),
	   6/23/05.

4	c  This release fixes a problem with the Apply button in the GFA window.
	   ES, (SJ), 6/30/05.

8.13.19
4	a  This release changes the formatting mechanism within the airmet text 
	   reports.  It now uses a two stage xslt transformation.  The first stage
	   produces the correct content for the airmet and the second stage puts 
	   the airmet into the correct format with regards to line indentation 
	   and blank space removal.  This change should be transparent to the 
	   user.  Also internal error checking within the xml library has been 
	   improved.  Additionally many AWC directed changes (from GFA team 
	   evaluation 6/1/2005) to the formatter have been included.  See testing
	   instructions for the full list.  ES, (DP), 8/4/05.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.14.	Refinements to filtering
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.15.	Smear point reduction
	
8.15.1
1	a  This release makes an internal change to the smear function design 
	   in order to be able to support the Smear All feature.  Also included 
	   is a new cgr routine that the Smear All will need to create the 
	   Outlook GFA.  ES, (SJ), 10/14/04.

1	b  Added a Smear All option to the smear gui.  This function creates
	   smears and outlooks for any series of snapshot GFA elements that are
	   of the same hazard type, sequence/updt number and tag value.  Revised 
	   the routine that compares relative severity of a GFA attribute.  
	   Smear/Smear All and Interpolation use this change.  Fixed an error in 
	   cst_rmtag() to handle a case of a tag with no value.  ES, (SJ), 
	   11/17/04.

1	c  fix aix5 crash in smear all. (Problem #1)  ES, (SJ), 11/23/04.

1	d  Fixed bug (failure to initialize two variables) in smear all.  This 
	   was fatal on non-linux platforms when there were snapshots to produce 
	   an outlook but not a smear.   ES, (SJ), 12/8/04.

8.15.2
	    
8.15.2.1
2	a  Created a stand-alone program which will create a snap table.  The 
	   snap table will be a station table of all the snapable points relative
	   to all the VORs nationwide, and will be used for GFA snapping.  JW, 
	   (ES), 1/24/05.

8.15.2.2
2	a  Added routines to snap the smeared polygons to VOR points.  BY, (SJ), 
	   2/4/05.

8.15.2.3
4	a  Added code to read the coordination points into the snap table.  BY,
	   (ES), 6/21/05.
	   
8.15.2.4
4	a  This release changes the snap implementation as per the recent AWC 
	   directives.  User drawn smears now may snap to points that result in a
	   larger or smaller area.  Edited smears may also snap to points that 
	   make the smear larger or smaller.  Points will now snap if there are 
	   no snap points within 10nm.  The search for a snap point will simply 
	   consider the nearest point(s) without the 10nm limit.  ES, (SJ), 
	   6/10/05.

4	b  Fixed the problem in the test report (smear points are deleted when 
	   two points have the same latitude or longitude). BY, (ES), 8/18/05.

8.15.2.5
4	a  Modify the build_snap program to allow command line inputs in order to 
	   dynamically set the VOR and coordination point radii.  ES, (SJ), 
	   7/13/05.

4	b  Corrected error in usage message.  The usage message incorrectly 
	   stated the program's default values.  ES, (SJ), 7/21/05.


8.15.3
2	a  Taken the tag value and update number into account when selecting
	   GFAs for a manual SMEAR.  If the second element's tag and/or update 
	   number do not match the first element's tag an/or update number, then 
	   no selection should occur.  JW, (ES), 12/22/04.
	   
 8.15.4
1	a  Added a new routine cgr_reducePts() to reduce the number of vertices 
	   in a polygon to a desired number while preserving the basic shape of 
	   the polygon as much as possible.  The number of vertices of a smeared 
	   GFA element is now limted to no more than 20 to fit the AWC's 
	   formatting restrictions.  JW, (ES), 10/4/04.

8.15.5
2	a  Added code to snap GFAs when editing them.  BY, (ES), 2/8/05.

2	b  This release fixes O2 in the first test report.  GFA smear points that
	   are already snap points are not reassigned now.  When doing a delete 
	   point, or move point the other points of a smear should not move.  
	   ES, (SJ), 2/15/05.

8.16
1	a  Modify the flight level interpolation of GFAs so that the interpolated
	   figures have flight levels rounded to the nearest 1000 feet.  ES, 
	   (SJ), 9/30/04.

8.17
2	a  Extended the Interpolation tool to work on non-closed lines and fronts.
	   The Interpolation tool will allow the users to add new elements but 
	   will take all the attributes for these new elements from the first 
	   selected element.  JW, (ES), 1/21/05.

8.19
4	a  Modified the code that produces the AIRMET text product(s) from GFA 
	   elements, specifically, pgairmet_format in the module nmap_pgairmet.c.
	   Since the rules for this production have been made clearer by AWC, 
	   much of the internal code have been scrapped and replaced with a new 
	   algorithm encapsulated in the new package afcreate.c.  JW, (DP), 
	   7/26/05.

4	b  Fixed the reported crash when reformatting a small GFA. JW, (ES),
	   8/9/05.

4	c  Addressed the following in GFA clipping: 1.Bug in clipping algorithm
	   holes in union prevented producing correct text report.  2.Removal of 
	   extra points resulting from GPC_UNIONs.  This involves removal of all 
	   points common to all three polygons involved in the GPC_UNION - poly1,
	   poly2 and the resulting union polygon.  3.Point reduction via prefs 
	   table entry SMEAR_REDUCE_THRESHOLD. Same as what is done for smear.
	   JW, (DP), 8/26/05.

8.20
1	a  Added an alternative smear routine that employs the 'rubber band' 
	   algorithm.  BY, (DP), 10/8/04.

8.23
2	a  Fix an interpolation bug.  If two GFAs of a hazard type that has no 
	   flight levels were interpolated, the new GFAs were given flight levels
	   of 000/XXX.  I added a check that doesn't try to add flight levels to 
	   GFA hazard types that have no flight levels.  ES, (SJ), 12/14/04.

8.24
4	a  The release removes the update number (also called sequence number) 
	   from the GFA GUI.  The smear tool and airmet formatter are updated to 
	   no longer use the sequence number.  Related test programs are updated 
	   as well.  ES, (SJ), 7/7/05.

NINE============================================================================

9.	Graph-to-Grid Improvements (G2G)

9.1.1
3	a  Added bounds blocking to the OA Barnes analysis programs.  The bounds 
	   could be either predefined bound area or VG files containing closed 
	   lines.  Multiple bound areas can be specified via '+' sign between 
	   bounds name.  The bound blocking results in:  all grid points inside 
	   of the blocking bounds will be marked as MISSED without objective 
	   analysis performed on them; all stations inside of the bounds will not
	   be used in analysis.  If the line segment between a grid point and a 
	   station intersects with the boundaries, that station will not be used 
	   in the analysis for that associated grid point. 

3	b  Fixed problem 1, observations 1 and 2 in the test report.  I believe 
	   the problem 2 is fixed too by this delivery.  But since SGI82 is down,
	   I cannot test.  BY, (DP), 5/9/05.

3	c  Remove reference to NC device driver in link scripts for OABSFC and 
	   OABSND.  Remove call to GSDEVA in oabnd.c; also, add bounds <tag>value
	   processing.  Pass through G2G option BOUNDS to parameter OABND for OA 
	   G2G processing.  Submit help files for DLINES parameter.  DP, (SJ), 
	   5/12/05.


9.1.4
3	a  Add the capability within G2G to process vector information using the 
	   OA library utilities.  ML, (DP), 5/6/05.

3	b  Move call to DG_INIT from OABSFC main program to OABSDR driver.  
	   Delete temporary work GEMPAK surface (ship) data file prior to exiting
	   GRPHGD.  Update GRPHGD help file.  DP, (SJ), 5/11/05.


9.1.5
3	a  Split OABSFC main program into a main program looping over the user 
	   input WHILE loop containing a new driver function OABSDR.  RT, (DP), 
	   4/25/05.

9.4
3	a  Added DISCRETE option to generate grids with discrete values instead 
	   of continuous.  Added DLINES option to allow use of Right_of_Line to 
	   help decide direction.  HZ, (DP), 4/29/05.

4	b  Fixed a bug that a correct string -1=0;1-2=1;2-3=2;3-4=3;4-=4”fails in
	   TESTIN option #30.  HZ, (DP), 8/18/05.

9.5	Handle categories
3	a  Implement a new GEMPAK parameter called CATMAP(categorical mapping) 
	   which would specify string->numeric/numeric->string assignment.  
	   HZ, (DP), 3/21/05.

9.6
3	a  Upgraded graph-to-grid driver, main program and nmap application to 
	   handle larger grids, specifically LLMXTG points.  Main program now 
	   written in C.  Upgrade grphgd link script.  Minor upgrade to error 
	   processing, trapping intersection exceedance.  Added the NDFD grid to 
	   grdnav.tbl.  DP, (SJ), 3/25/05.

9.8
4	a  Limited each text line to 80 characters for discrete.hl2.  HZ, (DP),
	   6/16/05.

9.9
4	a  Bug fix to assign RMISSD properly.  During previous development, the 
	   call to glimit was inadvertently moved to a section of code after 
	   missing values were assigned (after the number of contour lines = 0 
	   was detected).  DP, (SJ), 6/20/05.

9.10
4	a  Bug fixes - Correct misuse of 'FLT_MAX' in FORTRAN code; search for 
	   closest segment should be replaced with already-existing function; 
	   weighting algorithm (GDLWEI.f) needs to consider existence of 
	   intervening contour line between grid point locations (ala GWEIGS.f); 
	   right-of-line algorithm needs re-design to address 'shadow' areas; 
	   NMAP hangs when processing NDFD (i.e., large) grids; maximum number of
	   intersections needs to be increased from 30K to 50K.  DP, (SJ), 
	   7/21/05.

4	b  Implement new function cgr_qrol in G2G right-of-line determination 
	   (function gdline.f).  Remove leftover diagnostic print in function 
	   indiscrete.c.  DP, (ES), 8/2/05.

4	c  Bug fix triggered by NDFD grid. Removed rounding of computed 
	   intersection points to nearest 100th of a grid point. Also improved 
	   weighting fill by adding another scan loop. DP, (SJ), 8/10/05.

4	d  Deliver function that should have been included in previous delivery.
	   Function GNEXTV.f needs to return values for fi and fj for every case.
	   DP, (SJ), 8/16/05.

4	e  Fixed problems for the path of output file in G2G.  TL, (SJ), 9/1/05.

TEN=============================================================================

10.	SPC Outlook Product Generation (SPC OTLK)

1	1a  Added station relative information at the bottom of the Outlook 
	    Points product PTSDY#.  Replaced subroutines D2PDAY1, D2PDAY2, and 
	    D2PDAY3 with D2PDAY.  FY, (SJ), 11/4/04.

2	2a  Added to the FORMAT OUTLOOK gui, DAY4-DAY7 and DAY4-8 options.  
	    Updated the outlook times table to give the correct times in the gui.
	    Also modified the outlook file for tornado, total severe, and 
	    thunderstorm outlooks.  GG, AH, (SJ), 12/14/04.

ELEVEN==========================================================================

11.	Watch-By-County (WBC)

11.1.2
3	a  Added Watch Corner Point (WCP) text product creation via the WOU 
	   update program, WOUPDT.  For the WCP text product and their VG files, 
	   no TEST watch information should appear in these files.  Fixed rebun.c
	   so if the expansion flag is omitted from the command line, the program
	   won't seg. fault.  The default is set to 1 - expand.  Fixed cvg_rebun 
	   when a single county was given in testcvg.  This was a bug found in 
	   5.7.4.  AH, (SJ), 4/11/05.

11.1.3
3	a  Added a new decoder DCWCP for the Watch Corner Points product and a 
	   display capability in NMAP2 and GPMAP.  Updated TESTGG for new display
	   subroutine GGWCP.  FY, (SJ), 4/22/05.

3	b  Multiplied longitudes by -1 to place data in the U. S. for decoder 
	   DCWCP.  FY, (SJ), 5/9/05.

3	c  Added new DCWCP decoder to the LDM configuration file.  SJ, (DK), 
	   5/11/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.7	OTE Refinements

11.7.1
1	a  Added a '+ 1' to line 78. This will increment the counter past the
	   last slash on the first VTEC line.  Removed line 79 'IF' check. 
	   This was an unecessary check.  AH, (SJ), 9/29/04.

11.7.2
1	a  Updated county, marine, public forecast zones and marine county 
	   maps and tables that will be effective after November, 2004.  
	   RT, (AH), 11/3/04.

11.7.3
1	a  Fixed the search for the UGC line.  If the UG codes are missing, stop 
	   the search and print an error message to the log.  This modification 
	   prevents an infinite loop from occurring.  AH, (SJ), 10/28/04.

2	    4a  WBC bug fixes per user requests.  Do not allow watch processing 
		to continue if a watch's duration is <2 hrs and longer than 6 hrs
		and if an existing watch will be overwritten.  The code for QC 
		inputs in the FORMAT WATCH gui has been redesign to clean it up.
		HZ, (AH), 12/16/04.

1	    5a  Changed the values for the two entries *_USE_VTEC from '0' to 
		'2'.  GG, AH, (SJ), 11/18/04.

2	    7a  Uncommented the addition of TEST... to the WOU text product. 
		Extended the initial watch expiration time from 6 hours to 8 
		hours.  GG, SJ, (SH), 2/9/05.

11.7.6
3	a  Made changes for wbc_dsts to allow whether or not to remove the marine
	   zones from the states string.  AH, (SJ), 3/25/05.

11.8
1	a  Added dual level clustering when generating active counties in watch 
	    and list element creation/modification.  The permanent clustering may
	    be turned on and off in $GEMTBL/confic/prefs.tbl only.  Transient 
	    clustering (currently clustering) may be turned on and off in the GUI
	    windows via radio buttons.  AH, (SJ), 10/18/04.

2	    1a  Reworked the search through the optional county cluster table and
		the permanent cluster tables.  The search now goes through the 
		optional table first then the permanent table.  Create a 'virtual'
		list of entries in the cluster structure for the permutations of 
		the permanent cluster table.  This addition aids in creating 
		expected behavior for turning on and off permanent cluster 
		groupings.  Added error checking when reading in the optional and
		permanent cluster tables.  This prevents seg. faults from 
		occurring in NMAP.  AH, (SJ), 2/14/05.

2	     b  Corrected a bug found in which if clustering was off and 
		permanent clustering was on, the permanent cluster group was not 
		being found due to an incorrect fips code setting.  AH, (SJ), 
		2/18/05.

11.9
1	a  Added county fill option for WATCHES.  HZ, (FY), 11/3/04.

1	b  Fixed problems (P#1 and S#1) per testing report.  HZ, (FY), 11/17/04.

11.10
1	a  Created a new VF subroutine, vfwrep.c.  The new subroutine is called 
	   by nmap_pgprd.c and testvf.c  HZ, (AH), 10/4/04.

11.11
1	a  Added the ability to update the watch List element using the most 
	   recent WCNs when creating the WSMs.  MG, (AH), 11/15/04.

11.12
1	a  Added additional wording to the SAW and SEL to indicate the WCP 
	   description is an approximate.  Added an additional flag to the 
	   prefs.tbl to enable this change independent of delivery of the 
	   software to SPC operations.  GG, AH, (SJ), 11/2/04.

11.13
1	a  Changed the IF check on the watch number from '< 1000' to '< 10000'.
	   This change is in the continuing watch section of the PWN and the 
	   SEL.  AH, (SJ), 10/28/04.

11.14
1	a  Made the WATCH STATUS SAVE gui editable.  Made changes to the old 
	   WSM so that edited changes will appear in the original WSM*.txt 
	   file.  AH, GG, (SJ), 11/4/04.

11.15.	Add options to WOUPDT to handle more VTEC codes
	
11.15.1
3	a  Added storing the VTEC action code decoded by the WCN decoder.  This 
	   code is placed with the significance code, separated by a ';'.  Added 
	   an additional check for possible marine zone names.  If the third 
	   character in the marine zone name is a 'Z' check if the fourth 
	   character is a numeric.  If it is print the warning message.  If it is
	   not, then the name is a county name where the third letter is a 'Z'.  
	   AH, (SJ), 3/10/05.

11.15.2
3	a  Added 3 new flags (e,o and u) to WOUPDT.  The program determines 
	   whether or not to create a product based upon which flag is used and 
	   which action codes are found.  Updated the final WOU to make a 
	   distinction between the SPC or the WFOs canceling/expiring a watch.  
	   Made corrections to the update program and WOU display based on bugs 
	   found by the SPC (email 03/11/05).  Updated the woupdt.hlp file.  The 
	   corrections are (1) the EXT from WFO TSA at 1714Z picked up in the 
	   1716Z WOU.  Also the 2013Z WCN EXT in the 2016Z WOU.  (2) A bad UGC 
	   line in the final WOU at 2046Z.  (3) Have the '$$' above the attention
	   string in the final-WOU.  (4) If the first line of a decoded WOU 
	   contains a watch cancellation and the next line was a new WOU, the new
	   WOU would not display in NMAP.

11.15.3
4	a  Various checks have been added to create WOU-update and WOU-final 
	   products when the woudef.tbl or certain tag files are not accessible.
	   The particular sections of the products include the MND and the VTEC 
	   line.  When woudef.tbl or a tag entry is not accessible a default 
	   value is set so the product/s can still be created and an error 
	   message is created via ER_WMSG.  In addition the UPDT_WOU_PROD_CODE is
	   used to determine if WBC is operational and can be used this fall so 
	   the software knows the WOU-update is operational.  Fixed HPUX from 
	   crashing when running WOUPDT for midnight.  Corrected the local time 
	   string for midnight and noon.  Corrected extraneous characters in the 
	   VTEC string.  Fixed SPC reported problem “woupdt -e and -u flag issues
	   in which multiple identical WOUs were being issued.  Fixed SPC reported
	   problem with erroneous WOUs issued for a watch having a CON in the 
	   VTEC action code for a watch that had already been canceled by the i
	   SPC.  GG, FY, (DP), 8/4/05.

4	b  Corrected the error number for calling ER_ WMSG when one of the tags 
	   FINL_WOU_PROD_CODE_CAN or FINL_WOU_PROD_CODE_EXP is missing and a 
	   watch is being replaced in nmap2. FY, (SJ), 8/17/05.

11.15.5
3	a  Reworked the logic in finding the VTEC lines in WCNs.  The logic is 
	   made smarter by also looking for the product code with the forward 
	   slash.  AH, (SJ), 3/24/05.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.16.	Check for non-contiguous cnty inclusion -or- internal cnty exclusuion
	
11.16.1
4	a  Added a county inclusion/exclusion quality control check for Watch 
	   Specifications and County List Window.  HZ, (FY), 7/15/05.

11.16.2
2	a  Make NMAP reorder functions new CGR routine.  HZ, (AH), 12/22/04.

11.16.3
2	a  Created a new CLO bounds function, clo_blasso, which takes a string of
	   bound tags, semi-colon separated, and returns a polygon structure from
	   the union of the polygons designated by the bound tags.  Added

	   exclusion QC feature.  Improved the performance of displaying county 
	   WOU data (using markers, outlining, and fill). FY, (SJ), 8/9/05.

11.17.6
3	a  Added a check for the number of minutes difference when a canceled 
	   watch is found.  Also, added in the check to check back 6 hours for

	    Chesapeake Bay, Tidal Potomac and Delaware Bay), as well as Puerto 
	    Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, to the areas whose UGCs are included
	    in the TCV watch/warning text message.  Split up Pamlico and Albemarle
	    Sounds for selection in pgen.  Fix a bug found in plotting and 
	    determining UGCs when a watch/warning crosses the Texas/Mexico border.
	    DK, (SJ), 2/15/05.

2	b  Improved checks on conflicting or redundant VTEC codes for the same 
	   UGCs.  Ensured storm name is upper case in TCV message.  DK, (SJ), 
	   2/18/05.

	   from Fortran. (Fixes P1 on the last test report.)  SJ, (DK), 2/22/05.

12.7
2	a  Added scale legend to GPTCWW and GPTPC.  TP, (SJ), 1/10/05.

2	b  Enhanced per TPC instructions to add title and mask.  TP, (SJ),
	   1/19/05.

12.10
3	a  Improved TCA GUI to use arrow keys to select TCA segments.  Fixed 
	     the arrow key functions for roaming.  BY, (ES), 3/14/05.
	
12.11
3	a  Added three forecast track plotting parameters to program GPTCWW, for 
	   line type, width and color.  Also added a flag to plot the scale 
	   legend box, since it has been discovered that sometimes the scale 
	   legend box overlaps the forecast track on the plot.  Fixed minor bugs 
	   in the decoding subroutines.  MG, (DK), 3/22/05.

12.12	Enhancements and Fixes

12.12.1
2	a  Added a flag to suppress plotting of the cyclone's forecasted track 
	   and also size multipliers for the cyclone's forecast position markers,
	   as optional input parameters for program GPTCWW.  Changed the calling 
	   sequence for function gh_tcww to allow for variable size forecasted 
	   position markers, as well as to make plotting of the forecasted track 
	   dependent on the flag itrack.  Made changes in the help and text files
	   to reflect the changes in the program.  MG, (DK), 1/21/05.

12.12.2
2	a  In the portion of the code where the map area is being calculated,
		changed the way the total number of breakpoints is calculated, 
		taking into account lists of breakpoints.  MG, (DK), 1/25/05.

12.12.3
2	a  Made improvements to the tropical cyclone watch/warning text product 
	   (TCV  Tropical Cyclone VTEC) as requested by the TPC and to conform to
	   VTEC specifications.  Bug fix for clo_rdstn to ensure that correct 
	   columns are read.  MG, (DK), 1/25/05.

2	b  Fixed the bug in function GH_WWTX that caused problems with reading 
	   TCV_HEADER from prefs.tbl.  MG, (DK), 2/11/05.


12.12.4
2	a  Added code to check the validation of the time input in the TCA dialog.
	   BY, (ES), 12/22/04.

2	b  Fixed the problem 1 in the test report (hour = 24 or min = 60).  BY, 
	   (ES), 12/29/04.

12.12.5
3	a  Modified the TCA breakpoint selection process and associated plotting 
	   and TCV text message creation routines, to separate the Florida Keys 
	   from the south Florida coastline.  Modified the way that water 
	   segments are grouped in the text message.  Made minor bug fixes for 
	   message format and plotting.  Added new official breakpoint overlay 
	   table.  DK, (ES), 4/29/05.

12.12.6
2	a  Added timezone menu to the TCA window.  BY, (ES), 1/4/05.

2	b  Added timezone entries in the tca info table and PST/PDT into the
	   default timezone list.  BY, (ES), 1/11/05.

12.12.7
2	a  Fixed a problem with breakpoint selection.  Certain breakpoints with 
	   long names and a long entry in the column 10 field of the tcabkpt.tbl 
	   generated too large a string for the routine that searched for the 
	   lat/lon position of the station.  As a result these long-named 
	   stations would end up with missing lat/lon values and the TCA segment 
	   would not be drawn correctly.  ES, (SJ), 1/10/05.

12.12.8
2	a  Added a new Save TCA button at the bottom of TCA Attributes window.  
	   HZ, (ES), 2/4/05.

2	b  This release corrects observations O1 and O2 above.  ES, (SJ), 2/15/05.

12.12.9
2	a  Added code in cdstca.c to plot TCA segments in the correct order.
	   Modified nmap_pgtca.c to redraw TCA only once when handle bars are 
	   removed.  BY, (ES), 1/10/05.

12.12.9.1
3	a  Added issue status into the TCA structure.  Removed the year field 
	   from the TCA GUI.  Fixed a bug when creating a new TCA segment, the 
	   first break point is removed more than five times.  BY, (ES), 4/14/05.

12.12.9.2
3	a  Modified the code to include the issuing status in the TCA text 
	   message VTEC lines, and to add extra text for test messages.  BY, 
	   (DK), 4/20/05.

3	b  Changed the order of TCA issuing status in the option menu.  BY, (ES),
	   4/28/05.

12.12.9.3
3	a  This release modifies the behavior of the TCA.  When the user is 
	   drawing a new segment a MB2 event will not pop down the TCA window.  
	   Instead it will reset the TCA an allow selection from the geography 
	   menu.  ES, (SJ), 3/21/05.

12.12.9.4
3	a  This release changes the way islands and water segments are displayed 
	   in the segment list in the TCA window.  Before a generic label of 
	   Islands1 or Water2 was used.  Now all breakpoints in the segment are 
	   put in the list entry.  The list will scroll horizontally as needed.  
	   ES, (SJ), 4/15/05.

3	b  This fixes a minor problem with the control buttons in the TCA window 
	   which was an issue on hpux11.  All other platforms seem ok with the 
	   fix.  ES, (SJ), 4/25/05.


12.12.9.5
3	a  This release changes the color of the active breakpoint during a 
	   segment edit.  It used to be red but that is not visible for hurricane
	   warnings (which are red).  Now the active point is cyan, which is 
	   visible against all of the tropical cyclone watches and warnings.  
	   ES, (DK), 4/21/05.

3	b  This release keeps the edited segment selected in TCA list, fixing O1 
	   above.  ES, (SJ), 5/6/05.

12.12.9.6
4	a  This release fixes the memory leak found in the tca text product as 
	   well as a host of other small leaks in the interface to X/Motif 
	   routines.  Mostly these leaks involved throwing away pointers to space
	   that X had allocated.  ES, (SJ), 6/1/05.

4	b  Fixed a bug that crashes nmap2 when creating TCA text.  BY, (ES),
	   6/15/05.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.13
3	a  Developed a new stand alone program TCACANCEL to create a TCV 
	   (“Tropical Cyclone VTEC”) text message that will cancel all tropical 
	   cyclone watches and warnings.  ML, (DK), 4/7/05.

12.14
4	a  Modified subroutine GH_TCLB so that the scale legend will always be 
	   plotted at the top of the Hurricane Track/Watch/Warning graphic.  Also,
	   the calculation of the legend box position was modified in subroutine 
	   GH_KGIP to use different min/max coordinates.  SG, (SJ), 8/2/05.

2	b  Addressed problem # 2 from previous test report.  Also fixed two 
	   problems reported by the OPC.  First, NSHARP seg faulted if selecting
	   multiple model times using the control button.  Second, when changing
	   the parcel method, only the currently viewed sounding was updated.  
	   It now functions the way next page does, all soundings are changed to
	   the changed parcel method.  Also did a little clean-up.  Used proper 
	   calling sequence on callback functions and added check on count for 
	   expose events.  TP, (SJ), 1/3/05.

2	c  Fixed a bug found during procedural testing of v5.8.2.  Clicking 
	   'Next Page' with no data loaded causes a segmentation fault.  TP, 
	   (SJ), 2/17/05.

14.2.
14.2.1
3	a  Update text listing with frame advance.  TP, (SJ), 3/10/05.

SIXTEEN=========================================================================

16.	Volcanic Ash Advisory Product (VAA)

16.2
3	a  Made table-driven list of OTHER VAA types.  HZ, (DP), 4/12/05.

3	b  1.  Automatic time insertion - a) Remove inserted time from OBS ASH 
	   CLOUD section.  Keep it in the FCST ASH CLOUD sections.  b) Round off 
	   inserted times to the nearest half-hour.  2.  OTHERS-FCST drop down 
	   menu - a)Remove FL from the front of SFC for the level information.  
	   b) Seemingly, the second cloud per forecast from the OTHERS does not 
	   appear in the final VAA.  3.  Bug fix - a) in nmap_pgvolw.c, search 
	   for the variable tagstr3 and increase it's dimension from 25 to LLPATH
	   to accommodate possible path lengths.  Also increase global variables 
	   _lpfPath and _txtPath from 25 to LLPATH.  Make sure the VAA.txt file
	   gets created in the proper directory.  HZ, (DP), 5/6/05.

3	c  Made sure 'FL' is properly prepended to flight levels (except 'SFC').
	   HZ, (SJ), 5/13/05.

16.3

	   QUICK, END, or NEAR.  Updated vaa.tbl.  HZ, (DP), 6/10/05.

4	b  Mods per NESDIS / SAB testing results (insert a " " prior to MOVING 
	   when formatting).  DP, (SJ), 6/27/05.

4	c  Make sure "FL" is appropriately prepended to the flight levelsi; i.e., 
	   prepend before the lower level unless the lower level is "SFC"; never 
	   prepend before the upper level unless the lower level is "SFC".  
	   Implement option for for (lat,lon) point format... currently the 
	   format is "%s%04d%s%05d"; replace using the prefs table with 
	   "%s%04d %s%05d" which will allow a return the current.  This 
	   implementation required changes to clo_from.  DP, (SJ), 8/2/05.

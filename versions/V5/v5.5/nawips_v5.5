	( * indicates a change that makes this version of NAWIPS
	    incompatible with the previous version )


001.	ASCII Decoders

a	a. Modified decoders dchrcn, dcisig, dcwarn and dcwtch to flag "TEST"
	   reports in decoded output.  Minor bug fixes and improved error 
	   checking for dcisig and dcwarn.  New generic routine dcitim added
	   to get issue time.  New routine strpsl allows trailing blanks
	   on substrings used in search and replace operations.  Done, DKW,
	   (TP), 3/28/00.

a	b. Modified the marine surface (ship) decoder and the land surface
	   synoptic decoder to save the raw (undecoded) report.  It can be
	   displayed using the TEXT parameter.  The parameter CLDS was added
	   to the metar parameter display list for nmap and nmap2 at the 
	   request of the AWC.  Done, AH, (TP), 4/5/00.

a	c. Modified list of WMO headers and originating stations which will be
	   processed by the international SIGMET decoder (dcisig).  Done in
	   anticipation of April 17 change from KMKC to KKCI.  Done, DKW, (TP),
	   4/5/00.

a	d. Corrected the decoding of mean sea level pressure from the remarks
	   section of Mexican reports, in response to an unannounced format
	   change made on April 1.  Done, DKW, (TP), 4/10/00.

a	e. Modified aircraft decoder dcacft to decode more formats of turbulence
	   data reported in AIREPs (aircraft reports) and PIREPs (pilot reports),
	   in response to AWC request.  Done, DKW, (TP), 4/14/00.

a	f. Added the decoding of Volcanic Ash reports (excluding EGGY and RJAA)
	   to dcisig.  Updated EGGY routines with changes implemented March
	   2000 to the non-EGGY dcisig routines.  Bug fix for preamble 
	   processing.  Added parameter for limiting string search in IS_MOV.
	   Done, FY, (TP), 4/14/00.

b	g. Added the decoding of Marked Mountain Wave reports in dcisig.
	   Replaced isegtb with isegtm.  Fixed bug for decoding a single digit
	   lat/lon field for open areas.  Done, FY, (TP), 4/28/00.

b	h. Decode the day f the month, when reported, from within each individual
	   AMDAR report, in accordance with new WMO regulations that took affect
	   on May 3, 2000.  Done, JA, DKW, (TP), 5/10/00.

b	i. The marine surface (ship) decoder dcmsfc has been modifed to permit
	   the creation of 6-hour files of ship only data, at the request of 
	   the TPC.  This mode of running is an addition to, not a replacement 
	   of, the current mode in which hourly files of all marine surface data 
	   (ship, CMAN, fixed and drifting buoys) are created.  A separate
	   instance of the decoder (using command line option "-a 6") must be 
	   run to create the 6-hour ship files.  Done, DKW, (TP), 5/15/00.

b	j. Modified DCISIG, which decodes international SIGMET reports, to
	   distinguish between EGGY and RJAA reports by suffixing the SIGMET
	   number with the letter "E" or "J".  Also changed the separator for
	   the volcanic location from a blank to a comma.  Modified routine
	   GG_ISIG which displays international SIGMETS in GPMAP to include
	   volanic ash symbol and marked mountain wave label.  Updated help 
	   files.  Done, FY, (TP), 5/16/00.

b	k. The aircraft decoder dcacft is being modified to use airline-supplied
	   tables for decoding turbulence in some aireps.  One-digit wind
	   speeds are now allowed in aireps.  Done, DKW, (TP), 5/24/00.

c	l. Improved the header decoding logic for the warning decoder, DCWARN.
	   The subroutine WNGHDR.f, has been rewritten to find information
	   based on indexing.  This change allows for decoding warnings sent
	   with incorrect headers; such as those that contain ZCZC.  Done,
	   AH, (TP), 6/13/00.


c	m. Changed international SIGMET decoder (dcisig) to accept bulletins
	   from Guam beginning with WSPQ, instead of WSPQ2.  Done, DKW, (TP),
	   6/16/00.

c	n. Enhanced the hurricane decoder, DCHRCN, with the additions of
	   decoding the wind and sea ft radii, and the forecasted track lat.
	   and lon. positions.  Incorporated into the GPMAP parameter, HRCN, 
	   the flags to plot the wind and sea feet radii and the forecasted
	   track of the last valid storm position.  Labels are still plotted
	   for each time position, if selected.  Done, AH, (TP), 6/26/00.

d	o. Modified DCISIG to decode flight levels without the "FL" prefix.  
	   Done, FY, (TP), 7/11/00.

d	p. Changed the key word for finding the initial latitude in the 
	   hurricane decoder, DCHRCN.  Done, AH, (TP), 7/11/00.

d	q. Modified DCISIG to decode PHFO international SIGMET reports from
	   Hawaii.  PHNL has been replaced by PHFO as the originating station
	   for these reports.  Done, FY, (TP), 7/13/00.

d	r. Created a new decoder, DCAIRM, that decodes airmet reports.  Done,
	   DKW, (TP), 7/24/00.

d	s. Added the phenomenon type 'TC' to the international SIGMET decoder.
	   Also added the tropical cyclone symbol to ISIG display in GPMAP.
	   In place of the flight level string, the central pressure and
	   maximum winds are displayed if the flight level label is activated.
	   Done, AH, (TP), 8/3/00.

d	t. Fixed hurricane decoder such that when correction indication is 
	   placed in the body of the report, the correction flag is set.  
	   Done, AH, (TP), 8/16/00.

d	u. Created a new decoder, DCNCON, that decodes non-convective sigmet
	   reports (WMO headers WSUS1, WSUS01).  The output is written to an
	   ASCII file.  Done, DKW, (TP), 8/18/00.


002.	GRIB Decoder


003.	Grid Diagnostics


004.	Parameter Calculations


005.	Image Processing

a	a. Removed $GEMPAK/install/setup_links, $GEMPAK/install/remove_links,
	   $STRIP, and $RANLIB from all affected scripts.  This will eliminate
	   the need to setup and remove logical links to the include files
	   every time a file is compiled.  In all 214 scripts were modified.
	   Created a new script to set-up necessary links one time under
	   $GEMINC, create_links.  A script to remove the links, though
	   rarely - if ever - used, was created, undo_links.

	   edited in the NMAP2 user interface.  Done, SJ, (TP), 3/28/00.

a	d. Changed display routines for watches, warnings, international
	   SIGMETs and hurricane tracks to indicate TEST events.  For TEST
	   reports, bounded areas will now be shown with a dashed line,
	   markers will be open (rather than filled) and point events
	   (e.g., tropical depression) will have a 'T' displayed next to
	   the event symbol.  (A report must have the word TEST occurring
	   at least twice in its text to be flagged as a test report.)
	   The order for colors and symbols in the parameter HRCN has been
	   changed.  The order for colors is now hurricanes, tropical storms,
	   tropical depressions and directional arrows, and for symbols the
	   order is hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions.
	   Done, DKW, (TP), 4/3/00.

a	e. Created the VF files that will create the watch outlook update -
	   initial (WOU), aviation watch notification (AWN) and the public

	   low instrument flight rules as a separate category, at the request 
	   of AWC.  Done, DKW, (TP), 5/3/00.

b	p. Changed how the text files are opened.  They now overwrite existing
	   files instead of appending if the same watch was re-issued.  Added
	   'PARISHES' for Louisiana, instead of using 'COUNTIES'.  Removed
	   the AFOS headers and added the appropriate WMO and AWIPS headers.
	   Done, AH, (TP), 5/8/00.

b	q. Made changes to various cfl path and filename strings to use defines

	   inverted COS curve is used to represent seasonal height variations.
	   Done, TL, (TP), 5/16/00.

b	u. Added volcanic ash and mountain waves to international SIGMET
	   plotting for NMAP2.  Added attribute processing for same to ggisig.

	   Tropical Cyclone Forecast) tracks in GPMAP using the new GEMPAK
	   variable ATCF.  Changed plotting defaults in GPMAP for miscellaneous
	   data types (HRCN, ISIG, WATCH, WARN) so that if a color is omitted
	   from the input line, a default color will be assigned (rather than
	   suppress plotting of the symbol or line).  Updated help and text 
	   files.  Done, DKW, (TP), 6/13/00.

c	aa. Added boundary structures to CLO library include file in preparation
	    for future development.  Done, DP, (TP), 6/19/00.

	    a new include file MCHPRM.PRM.  Also renamed FORTRAN include files 
	    to uppercase; e.g., error.prm to ERROR.PRM AND removed the "GEMINC:" 
	    from in front of ALL include statements that referenced it.  Over 
	    2500 FORTRAN files and include files are affected!  Done, TP, RC, 
	    (TP), 6/20/00.

c	dd. Fixed a problem where an Intl Sigmet line containing 70 points
	    caused nmap to crash.  Done, HZ, (TP), 6/26/00.

	    alphabetize them.  Modified the logic for separating cities from
	    counties.  Done, AH, (TP), 6/28/00.

c	ff. Corrected a bug found in displaying the radii and forecasted tracks
	    for the last time period of each storm.  Incorporated hurricane flags

d	nn. Bug fix for ATCF (Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast) display in
	    NMAP2 and GPMAP.  Corrects problem where, if an actual track 
	    position was missing for a requested time, the remainder of the
	    actual track was plotted as a solid line, where it should be dashed.
	    Done, DKW, (TP), 7/27/00.

d	oo. Fixed a bug if the advisory valid time is later than the system
	    time, symbols and labels were not being plotted, but the arcs and
	    forecasted tracks were plotted.  Done, AH, (TP), 7/27/00.

d       pp. Wrote new routine GG_AIRM to be used to display airmets in GPMAP

	   array size for satellite and radar files.  Done, TL, (TP), 7/27/00.

d	p. Made several changes in SNCROSS: Color filled underground depiction; 
	   Customized BORDER line input; Increased background grid resolution 
	   to better define data boundaries; and enable generating a GIF 
	   product.  Done, TL, KB, (TP), 8/3/00.

d	q. Modified GEMPAK programs with graphical output in order to allow
	   generation of GIF images.  Done, RC, (TP), 8/7/00.

d	r. Added grid shifting for CED and MER grids to any map projection
	   display.  This will fix the contour discontinuities on the
	   greenwich meridional boundary, particular for derived fields.
	   Done, TL, (TP), 8/23/00.


012.	General GUI Modifications

	   and cursor size used in GUI applications.  Created large size cursor 
	   bitmaps.  Done, HZ, (TP), 5/16/00.

b	b. Added incorrect table info. check for cursor edit.  Done, HZ, (TP), 
	   5/23/00.

b	c. Changed the location of the sigmet edit, watch status product, and
	   outlook product popup boxes in the nmap resource file.  Done, SJ,

	   'County_names' overlay the first-time.  Done, MLI, (TP), 8/24/00.

d	h. Updated nafos, ntrans, and nsat to work with the recent changes to
	   xwcmn.h.  Done, ES, (TP), 8/25/00.


014.	NTRANS


015.	NSAT


016.	NWX

b	a. Fixed display of the Current Watches by initializing the search
	   string.  Done, SJ, (TP), 5/24/00.


017.	AFOS


018.	NMAP

a	a. Modified to display full station names instead of station ids on
	   seek result window.  Done, HZ, (TP), 3/28/00.

a	b. Fixed problem report 299:P1, failure to update vg elements after
	   an auto-update (nmap2 only).  Done, ES, (TP), 3/28/00.

a	c. Unified maximum search radius unit in cloud-to-height option
	   popup window.  Set cursor function.  Done, TL, (TP), 3/28/00.

a	d. Unified the use of font on Seek Results Window.  Reduced the size of
	   Seek Results Window.  Cleared out the "Seek Results" scroll list when 
	   input is invalid or implies multiple choices.  Added error checking
	   for invalid lat/lon input.  Done, HZ, (TP), 4/5/00.

a	e. Fixed a bug where vgf elements drawn in one loop did not end up in
	   the correct place in other loops.  Fixed an auto-update bug where
	   if auto-update occured during an active loop, the loop delays got
	   really confused.  Done, ES, (TP), 4/10/00.

a	f. Modified the pixmap loading in nmap2.  The loop selected to be in
	   view is loaded first, then all the other loops are loaded in the
	   background.  Simplified the routines that load data.  Done, ES,
	   (TP), 4/11/00.

a	g. Added a new font size, GIANT to the TEXT parameter and incorporated
	   it into NMAP and NMAP2.  Done, AH, SJ, (TP), 4//12/00.

a	h. Fixed NMAP2 problem that occurs when a loop is actively looping and 
	   the map window popped up, selecting a different map results in the 
	   map window oscillating between the previously drawn map and the newly 
	   selected map.  Done, ES, (TP), 4/12/00.

a	i. Fixed a bug in NMAP2. IF the OBS 'Parm Edit' box was up when MISC
	   data was selected, NMAP2 would crash.  When a VGF file was selected,
	   the path name would appear in the title bar for the 'Parm Edit' box.
	   Done, AH, (TP), 4/14/00.

a	j. Syncronized the loop selection menu on the data window with the
	   loop in view.  Done, ES, (TP), 4/18/00.

a	k. Modularized moist-adiabatic cloud height.  Cloud height resorted to
	   moist-adiabatic search if needed.  Created a status message widget
	   in cloud-to-height function.  Cloud-to-height default values
	   table driven.  Fixed a bug in the sounding table reading routine.
	   Done, TL, (TP), 4/18/00.

a	l. Fixed NMAP2 problems 308:2-5,7.  Problems 2-4 were caused by 
	   nmap_zoomw.c which was not setting the flag that indicates changes
	   have been made to the data set.  Problem 5 was corrected by disabling
	   loop selection within the map window, including selection by the
	   F1-4 keys.  Problem 7 was caused by not storing the current
	   pixmap pointer in loops not currently in view.  Done, ES, (TP),
	   4/19/00.

a	m. Fixed fatal error in NMAP after loading data, looping, pop-up map
	   window, then hit any button.  Stopped looping whenever the loop
	   buttons are made insensitive.  Done, ES, (TP), 4/21/00.

a	n. Modified NGD_DSPL to use the grid file alias instead of constructing
	   an expicit file name.  Added the ability to override the title line
	   number from the restore file.  Done, SJ, (TP), 4/21/00.

a	o. Fixed a bug in NMAP2 that disabled auto-update.  Done, ES, (TP), 
	   4/21/00.

a	p. Fixed problem #318:p2.  The line between two seek points is redrawn
	   if the user moves to another frame in the loop sequence.  Done,
	   ES, (TP), 4/25/00.

b	q. Fixed zooming with a roam factor bug.  Fixed multiple zoom bug with
	   Mercator projection.  Done, ES, (TP), 5/1/00.

b	r. Fixed a problem with the ghosting for the seek function after
	   looping (320:P1) or roaming (320:P2).  Changed the zoom function
	   to work in a similar fashion.  Done, SL, (TP), 5/3/00.

b	s. Fixed loop switching in nmap2 when product generation is active 
	   (#311:P1, P2, & P3, #301:P6).  Fixed the station edit window.
	   Once the user has selected "Accept" in the station edit window any
	   subsequent "Load" call (from either the data window or the station
	   popup) will reload the data.  Also cleaned up xpgpaste.c.  This
	   routine pastes portions of the backup pixmaps to the viewed pixmaps
	   in order to refresh them when product generation is active.  This
	   change restricts xpgpaste's functioning to the current loop.
	   Done, ES, (TP), 5/3/00.

b	t. Added ability to remove bad frames from view.  Done, ES, (TP),
	   5/9/00.

b	u. This release contains fixes for test report 301:P5 (which is also 
	   Grosshans 2/14/00 #3 and Partain 2/29/00 #2).  The problem is that 
	   after selecting a data source, the map window does not show a map
	   that matches the data (in the case of images) and that a zoom and 
	   load in the map window does not result in zoomed data. 

	   Also included is a fix to bug 227:P6 which was also 270/1:P1.  The bug
	   showed up when the user modified a loaded data source to replace an 
	   image with a grid or metar source.  The image map was retained, rather
	   than switching to the default map.  The default map now results from 
	   such a modification.

	   And an unreported problem is also fixed.  Selecting "OK" in the edit 
	   box for miscellaneous data sources was not flagged as a change in 
	   selected data and hitting "Load" (without making other changes to the 
	   data window) did not reload the data.  Done, ES, (TP), 5/11/00.

b	v. The lut problem in the map window (when displaying an image) is now
	   corrected.  This fixes report 319:P1 and P2.  A problem with
	   resetting image data upon a "Cancel" (in the data window) is now
	   fixed.  Previously a reload of data would load a source which had
	   been selected, then canceled (ie not loaded).  Changing the
	   dominant source and hitting "Load" now loads the data.  This fixes a
	   problem Gregg Grosshans found.  The map button has been returned to
	   the data window.  Wipe is now available again.  It is located on the
	   main window (same place as in nmap), and pops a confirmation box.
	   If the user selects "OK" all data in the loop (only the loop that is
	   in view) is deleted, and the default map is redrawn.  This means
	   any image projection will be lost.  Done, ES, (TP), 5/15/00.

b	w. This release fixes three problems with auto-update in nmap2:  1)
	   Problem report #304:P1 -- problems keeping a zoomed image when other
	   loops are loaded; 2) Auto-update stays on even when image data is
	   not dominant; 3) Auto-update does not update the pixmap ( timeline
	   is updated though) when only 1 frame of data is loaded.  And the
	   cloud height button is now back in nmap2.  Done, ES, (TP), 5/17/00.

b	x. Changed the default watch label to 'Number' in the watch edit 
	   parameter box for both NMAP and NMAP2.  Done, AH, (TP), 5/17/00.

b	y. Made several adjustments to the way things work when a file is opened
	   or saved to include:  removing the path from the file name in the
	   input box; the input box only shows during a save; clicking OK in
	   the browse popup goes directly to work without an additional click
	   in the main popup; the paths for opening and saving are now stored
	   seperately.  Also, the labels at the bottom of the nmap window
	   were tightened up to allow a little more room for the VG file name.
	   Done, SL, (TP), 5/17/00.

b	z. Fixed a fatal error on aix4 introduced on 5/12/00 when loading radar
	   and miscellaneous data together.  Done, ES, (TP), 5/18/00.

b	aa. Added display of the NOAA logo to nmap and nmap2. The logo
	    attributes are set in logo.tbl and the logo selection is under the
	    Options menu in the programs.  Done, SJ, (TP), 5/18/00.

b	bb. Minor adjustments to the bottom line of nmap/nmap2.  Done, SL, (TP),
	    5/18/00.

b	cc. Fixed fatal flaw when pressing the hide loop button after loading
	    then wiping data.  This only appeared on the IRIX and LINUX
	    systems.  Done, SL, (TP), 5/22/00.

b	dd. Added cursor edit popup window to nmap&nmap2.  Done, HZ, (TP),
	    5/22/00.

b	ee. Fixed refreshing product generation after wiping the data from a 
	    loop in NMAP2.  Done, SL, (TP), 5/22/00.

b	ff. Fixed a bug in NMAP2: the logo would disappear after zooming.  Done,
	    SJ, (TP), 5/22/00.

b	gg. Fixed a bug in NMAP: the logo would disappear after zooming.  Done,
	    SJ, (TP), 5/23/00.

b	hh. Fixed a problem (332:P3) with the time line being updated after
	    attempting to load too many frames in NMAP2.  Also insured that
	    the most recent frames are used in such a case.  Done, SL, (TP), 
	    5/23/00.

b	ii. Changed array index counter variable and date/time string size to
	    a global variable.  Problems occurred when displaying/updating
	    images in NMAP if there were more files in an image directory than
	    declared by MAX_PIX.  This bug was found by UNIDATA.  Done, AH,
	    (TP), 5/23/00.

b	jj. Added 4 more loops and increased max pixmaps to 88.  Fixed #335:P1
	    and P2 where, load image in loop 1, switch to loop 2, select
	    another image source, hit map button and wrong map displayed and 
	    any selected zoom won't apply once load is clicked.  Done, ES,
	    (TP), 5/23/00.

b	kk. Added 6-hour ship files to surface obs display for NMAP and NMAP2,
	    at the request of the TPC.  Done, DKW, (TP), 5/23/00.

b	ll. Fixed two problems with the seek ghost lines (327:P2&3).  The first
	    is in NMAP2 when switching loops.  The second is in NMAP when 
	    clicking a new point while the frames are looping.  This is 
	    particularly apparent when there is no data loaded.  Done, SL,
	    (TP), 5/24/00.

b	mm. Fixed crash on hide/show.  Fixed inability to load data into loop
	    eight.  Done, ES, (TP), 5/24/00.

b	nn. Added Mountain Wave and Volcanic Ash Sigmets to the watch_warn
	    attribute edit in NMAP.  Done, SJ, (TP), 5/26/00.

b	oo. Fixed #341:P1, exit mouse button problem.  Done, ES, (TP), 5/30/00.

b	pp. Fixed loading problem in NMAP2 with multiple sources.  Done, ES,
	    (TP), 6/1/00.

c	qq. Removed all references to data type alias in the NMAP2 source code.
	    There were explicit checks for type UAIR in many places, and
	    checks for all major types in one routine.  Done, SJ, (TP), 6/13/00.

c	rr. Added a separator on locator pulldown menu.  Done, HZ, (TP), 6/13/00.

c	ss. Fixed a problem with auto update throwing hide/show out of sequence.
	    SL, (TP), 6/13/00.

c	tt. Fixed #344:P1:  Nmap2 can now distinguish between the same dominant
	    sources simultaneously in more than one loop.  Done, ES, (TP), 
	    6/13/00.

c	uu. Fixed problem (349:P5) where after loading image data, the data
	    window is raised, data cleared then canceled.  This would give an
	    error if the map window is then raised.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/13/00.

c	vv. Changed the data window to update the timeline's list of available
	    frames on popup.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/14/00.

c	ww. Fixed a couple of problems with time line updates for OBS and MISC
	    for NMAP2.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/19/00.

c	xx. Fixed 352:P3, and P4 (nmap2).  Both problems were the result of
	    confusion between the mapw window and the main window.  Done, ES,
	    (TP), 6/19/00.

c	yy. Fixed problem with the NMAP2 timeline with deselected frames not
	    adjusting the frame count correctly.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/20/00.

c	zz. Fixed a problem with managing and unmanaging "Data Source" option
	    menu on Data Selection Window of nmap2.  Done, HZ, (TP), 6/24/00.

c	aaa. Fixed reference time in NMAP2 so that the selected time is the last
	     frame shown on the timeline.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/24/00.

c	bbb. Fixed problem with the NMAP2 locator information not being changed
	     directly when the loop is switched.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/24/00.

c	ccc. Added the bad frame option to NMAP.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/26/00.

c	ddd. Fixed a problem in NMAP2 with hiding then showing an animated loop
	     and not have the loop button appear selected.  Done, SL, (TP), 
	     6/26/00.

c	eee. Fixed problem (361:P1,P2) in NMAP2 with changing loops while having 
	     an element selected.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/27/00.

c	fff. Fixed a load problem in nmap2.  If pgen is active and two loops
	     of data are loaded, the first displays correctly until the blank 
	     frame loads.  This loads correctly but then is displayed and left
	     in view while the rest of the data (meaning the other loop(s)) are 
	     loading.  So the user sees no data until all the other loops 
	     finish loading.  Also fixed auto-update so that if the loop being
	     updated is the one in view, the display automatically advances to 
	     the last frame, so the user will see the new data immediately.
	     Done, ES, (TP), 6/26/00.

c	ggg. Fixed a mismatch in fade settings after auto-update.  Fixed auto-
	     update button not being activated after initial load.  Fixed
	     bottom frame count not being updated after initial load.  Done,
	     ES, (TP), 6/28/00.

c	hhh. Fixed fatal error when selecting VG files as the dominant data 
	     source.  Fixed problem 362:P1, vg element burn in when switching 
	     loops in product generation.  Done, ES, (TP), 6/29/00.

c	iii. Fixed problem in NMAP2 with the projection not being reset after
	     autoupdating a loop not currently in view.  Done, SL, (TP), 7/3/00.

c	jjj. Reset LUT if loading a frame for printing so that the image data
	     will show up in NMAP2.  Done, SL, (TP), 7/3/00.

c	kkk. Fixed some navigational bugs in nmap2.  Done, ES, (TP), 7/5/00.

c	lll. Rolled back nmap from the 6/19 fix of problem #349:P5.  Done,
	     ES, (TP), 7/10/00.

d	mmm. Clean up nmap_dataw.c & nmap_dslw.c interaction; i.e., do not pass
	     pointer to entire data source structure.  Done, HZ, (TP), 7/11/00.

d	nnn. Fixed logo loading problem when loading a logo with multiple loops
	     with different roam factors.  Done, ES, (TP), 7/11/00.

d	ooo. Changed the map window to force a reload of the current loop any
	     time a "Load" is selected.  Done, ES, (TP), 7/12/00.

d	ppp. Modified the data selection in NMAP2 so that the last path 
	     accepted for each data category is "remembered".  Thus, when
	     a new source and category are selected, the last entries for
	     that category are highlighted.  This "remembering" works
	     accross loops.  Done, SL, (SS), 7/17/00 

d	qqq. Added the various U.S. possessions to the state list so that
	     the seek function would properly recognize those cities such
	     as San Juan Puerto Rico.  This corrects a problem found by the
	     TPC for both NMAP and NMAP2 seek function.  Done, SL, (SS), 
	     7/17/00.

d	rrr. Fixed a ghost line problem in NMAP/NMAP2 for seek function.
	     This problem occurred on the linux, irix, and sun platforms.
	     In some cases, multiple seek lines occurred.  Done, HZ, (SS),
	     7/17/00.

d	sss. Fixed a problem with the logo common to nmap and nmap2.  If
	     the logo position is defined without data loaded, then changing
	     map areas would not plot the the logo.  Done, ES, (SS), 7/17/00.

d	ttt. Added a new hot key (f/F) to nmap/nmap2 which resets the fade
	     and thus resets the look-up table that is loaded for the
	     viewed images.  This allows the user to re-load the look-up
	     table with a hot key when switching between instances of 
	     nmap and/or nmap2.  Done, SJ, (SS), 7/17/00.  

d	uuu. Fixed logo problem in NMAP where logo did not appear unless
	     the display window was clicked on.  This only happened in
	     the case when no data was loaded and the map area was
	     changed.  Done, SJ, (SS), 7/19/00.

d	vvv. Added new functions to save and restore the array of structure for 
	     data driver libraries: NIM, NGD, NMS, NSF and NSN.  This corrects
	     the nmap2 "cancel" problem.  Done, MLI, (TP), 7/19/00.

d	www. Fixed a bug in NMAP2 where it would crash if an empty image
	     directory was selected.  This bug only occured on HPUX 
	     platforms. Done, SJ, (SS), 7/20/00.

d	xxx. Fixed bugs in NMAP2 associated with accepting a new map area from
	     the Map window, with the Data window up. The loop buttons would
	     become active after the new map area was selected, but before any
	     data was loaded.  Done, SJ, (TP), 7/24/00.

d	yyy. Fixed icon tip bug for map bitmap button of Data Selection Window
	     of nmap2.  Done, HZ, (TP), 7/27/00.

d	zzz. Removed hardcoded checks for specific analysis grid types
	     (RUCS, RFC) and made the checks for forecast grids vs. analysis
	     grids based on the table entries in datatype.tbl.  Fixed the
	     timeline and loading order for analysis grids and surface forecast 
	     data, i.e. NGMMOS, etc. The analysis grids re now treated like 
	     observed data and the surface forecasts are handled like forecast 
	     grids.  Done, SJ, (TP), 8/2/00.

d	a1a. Added validation checks on any potential user change to the time
	     fields in the track function.  Done, HZ, (TP), 8/2/00.

d	a1b. Solved the "load" problem in "parm Edit" in nmap2.  Done, MLI,
	     (TP), 8/3/00.

d	a1c. Found and fixed a bug in NMAP2.  When the EDIT PARM window was up,
	     changing data source types from surface, mos, upper air to MISC
	     would cause NMAP2 to crash on 4 platforms.  Done, AH, (TP), 8/7/00.

d	a1d. A bug fix for Nmap station model editing in upper air data.
	     Done, TL, (TP), 8/7/00.

d	a1e. Modified NMAP to read image files with names of format YYMMDD_HHMM
	     or YYYYMMDD_HHMM.  Increased value of variable MAX_DIR_LAYER.
	     Done, RC, (TP), 8/14/00.

d	a1f. Fixed zoom preservation problem on a cancel in nmap2.  Done, ES,
	     (TP), 8/14/00.

d	a1g. Fixed a problem in NMAP2 where the file name template for the
	     satellite images on AWIPS would not work properly.  Done, SJ,
	     (TP), 8/14/00.

d	a1h. Fixed problem report #374:P1 - Increased the time string array size 
	     when 'Set Time' was used.  Done, AH, (TP), 8/16/00.

d	a1i. Initialize skip factor when modifying a source in NMAP2.  Done,
	     SL, (TP), 8/17/00.

d	a1j. Reactivated the "Default" button on the station model edit window.
	     Done, SJ, (TP), 8/18/00.

d	a1k. Fixed a time-line bug in nmap2.  Done, ES, (TP), 8/22/00.

d	a1l. Fixed seek when user selects a bound type.  Done, DP, (TP), 8/23/00.

d	a1m. Numerous fixes to seek.  Done, DP, (TP), 8/29/00.

d	a1n. Fixed NMAP2 bug where vg elements are not refreshed if wipe is
	     done while product generation is active.  Done, ES, (TP), 9/1/00.

	   NMAP2.  Done, MLI, TP, (TP), 5/15/00.

b	u. Added CLO_TGST to pgsigw_getState; removed the State Included widget
	   from the CONVECTIVE sigmet edit popup.  Done, MLI, (TP), 5/17/00.

b	v. Made a couple of fixes to SIGMETs brought to us by the AWC, notably
	   that the SIGMET from line was not being updated when moving from a
	   line to an area AND when drawing a CCF element after having drawn a
	   text element with a similar box, no text box is seen.  Also fixed
	   SIGMET line ghosting which was shown as closed.  Done, SL, (TP),

	   Linux.  Done, MLI, (TP), 5/23/00.

b	z. Fixed problem (302:P1, possibly same as 333:P1) in NMAP2 where exiting
	   product generation while having data loaded but hidden, the data is
	   showing after the exit is completed.  Done, SL, (TP), 5/23/00.

b	aa. Made the hurricane text box shorter ( 1 line ), wider and uneditable
	    and for the MPC the first 3 characters are '40O' in the text message.
	    Changed the cycle algorithm.  Done, AH, (TP), 5/23/00.

b	bb. In NMAP graph-to-grid processing, write the CNTRFL parameter
	    filename to the same directory that the input VGF was opened,
	    unless the CNTRFL filename already has an explicit path name.
	    Done, DP, (TP), 5/24/00.

b	cc. Fixed 321.P1 & 321.P2.  Inc./Dec. problems.  Done, HZ, (TP), 5/25/00.

b	ff. Changed MAXNOPT from 20 to 30 to max amount of names.  Changed watch
	    format to read names from forecasters table file.  Removed the
	    key word "FORECASTER" from the table.  Done, RC, (TP), 5/25/00.

b	gg. Increased the hurricane text box to 2 lines.  This fixes the 
	    problem on LINUX and AIX of the text line being scrolled up one
	    line, thus hidding the text line.  Done, AH, (TP), 5/25/00.

b	hh. Fixed problem 339:P1 - incorrect Storm Id on NMAP2 for hurricane
	    track on the platform of HPUX10.  Done, MLI, (TP), 5/26/00.

b	ii. Fixed two problems with the file open (340:P1&P2), associated
	    with appending incorrectly and not showing the proper file
	    list when appending a local file with a non-local file.
	    Done, SL, (SS), 5/26/00.

b	jj. Fixed VG file open problems:  could open null file name and the
	    file selection window shrank when toggling between file sort
	    options.  Done, ES, (TP), 5/30/00.

b	kk. Fixed ghosting problem.  Done, HZ, (TP), 5/30/00.

b	ll. Visual enhancement of open GUI.  Done, HZ, (TP), 5/31/00.

	    file open/save window and append '.vgf' to file names.
	    Done, ES, (TP), 6/5/00.

b	oo. Fixed the internal reference to a saved VG file, to ensure the
	    '.vgf' extension is always included.  Done, ES, (TP), 6/6/00.

c	pp. Enhanced the performance of calculating the State list from current
	    sigmet.  Done, MLI, (TP), 6/13/00.

c	qq. Made various changes to CCF elements, mostly notably removing
	    the vector elements from the displayed group.  Done, SL, (TP),
	    6/13/00.

c	rr. Fixed 349.P6:  Draw a front and Modify. Click Inc/Dec button and
	    draw a box.  Observe that smoothed lines are drawn for the box.
	    Done, HZ, (TP), 6/13/00.

c	ss. Added label color toggle to line, front, symbol and circle boxes.
	    Done, HZ, (TP), 6/14/00.

c	tt. Added a parameter to pggst_clearGhost().  Fixed 351.P1&P2, which is 
	    described as follows:  Created a line with solid open arrow.  Chose 
	    label option "OTHER".  Drew line and typed "Rainfall could exceed 
	    <CR> ffg values to the right <CR> of a line from".  Then proceeded 
	    to draw a line with a solid open arrow and filled.  Chose label 
	    option "OTHER" and drew another line.  The result is that on AIX4 
	    and IRIX6, nmap blew away; On HPUX10, IRIX5 and LINUX2, the windows 
	    were hung.  Done, HZ, (TP), 6/20/00.


c	uu. Changed the text attribute window so that the text field is not 
	    reset when a selection is made to the box type menu.  Done, ES,
	    (TP), 6/20/00.

c	vv. Modified the text reset for the box selection within the text
	    attribute window (pgen).  Done, ES, (TP), 6/29/00.

d	ww. Changed so that 'save' is treated as 'save as' after opening a new
	    file.  Done, SL, (TP), 7/11/00.

d	xx. Added another pane to the line, front, circle and symbol edit boxes.
	    The pane contains a non-editable text field. If the line/front/symbol
	    has a label associated with it, the text string will be copied into
	    this non-editable field. In this way the users will be able to tell
	    what the label is for the element they have selected.  Done, HZ,
	    (TP), 7/28/00.

d	yy. Fixed a bug of being unable to save the edited watch warning advisory
	    message.  Done, MLI, (TP), 8/4/00.

d	zz. Added a control mechanism to the time labels of the track.  Fixed a
	    GUI bug of Track Results Window on Linux, which is described as 
	    follows:  On Linux, draw a track and select it, you can't see the 
	    title bar of Track Results Window. And you can't move it either.
	    Done, HZ, (TP), 8/14/00.

d	aaa. Changed the palette to use a reverse colored pixmap to show 
	     selection rather than highlighting.  Done, SL, (TP), 8/17/00.

d	bbb. Modified the file open window so that it starts with the previously
	     selected directory highlighted(or Local if none has been selected)
	     and a matching file list for that directory.  Done, HZ, (TP), 
	     8/17/00.

d	ccc. Fixed line pattern size memory.  Done, SL, (TP), 8/18/00.

d	ddd. Fixed Graph-to-Grid bug where it sometimes ignored the GGLIMS
	     parameter and it sometimes crashed on Linux.  Done, DP, (TP),
	     8/21/00.

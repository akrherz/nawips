	( * indicates a change that makes this version of NAWIPS
	    incompatible with the previous version )



001.	ASCII Decoders

	a.  Changed the function dcb_peekc to return a return code
	    as well as the data to handle binary data.  In addition,
	    DC_OSNM was corrected to declare "parms" as a character
	    array.  Done, JW, (SS), 8/20/96.

	b.  Updated DCHRLY to ignore fractional visibilities that
	    do not have a unit indicator in METAR reports.  Done,
	    SC, SJ, (SS), 8/21/96.

	c.  Added a check to DC_GHDR to skip blank header lines.
	    Done, SJ, (SS), 9/10/96.

	d.  Fixed a typo in dcosnm.f that was causing no stations to 
	    be added to the decoded dataset.  Done, DK, (SS), 9/11/96.

	e.  Fixed a typed in DCADCD that was causing hourly decoder to 
	    not store the special reports.  Done, SJ, (SS), 9/12/96.

002.	GRIB Decoder


003.	Grid Diagnostics

	a.  Fixed check for invalid grid fields in DG_GETV that was
	    improperly prohibiting calculations for some valid vector
	    fields.  Also updated error message.  Done, TL, (SS), 
	    9/11/96.



004.	Parameter Calculations

005.	Image Processing


006.	GPLT Changes

        a.  Corrected DPWTH and DPTND so that symbols are always plotted 
	    using solid lines.  Corrected dimension of an array in IWTHR.
            Cleaned up utility program PLOTSYM.  Added three new weather symbols 
            to PLOTSYM.  Updated documentation for symbols.  Done,
            ML, (SS), 9/5/96.

	b.  Corrected GDRMAP to only check for map quadrants when using
	    CIA maps.  Done, GK, (SS), 9/6/96.  Tested, DK, complete, 
	    9/9/96.

007.	Device Drivers



008.	Documentation

	a.  Improved help for LUTFIL.  Done, SM, (SS), 8/21/96.


009.	Scripts/NTS files

010.	General GEMLIB/CGEMLIB Changes

	b.  Fixed a problem which caused the non-execution of programs
	    if $RESPOND is set to NO.  Done, KT, (SS), 8/21/96.  Tested
	    KT, complete 8/29/96.

	c.  Updated ST_RXBL so that it uses separate buffers for input
	    and output strings.  Also added the routine to TESTST.  
	    Also, updated ST_LSTC, ST_LSTF, and ST_LSTI for 
	    AIX systems.  Done, DK, (SS), 8/21/96.

	d.  Corrected IN_HILO to properly handle case where no semicolons 
	    are specified for symbol and range input strings.  Done,
	    GK, (SS), 9/4/96.

	e.  Corrected the size of the IMARK table dimension in the imark
	    routine.  Done, ML, (SS), 9/4/96.

	f.  Use GEMPAK earth radius instead of reading radius from McIdas 
	    header.  This change improves the navigation.  Also improved
	    the precision of navigation equations.  Done, TL, (SS), 8/12/96.
	    Tested TL, complete, 9/13/96.


011.	General GEMPAK Program Changes

	a.  Corrected GDPLOT problem where HI/LO plotting did not properly
	    function when options were specified.  User input variables
	    were increased to 72 characters.  Done, GK, (SS), 8/21/96.

	d.  Corrected SFGRAM so that it can handle 8 character station ID's.
	    Done, KB, (SS), 9/4/96.

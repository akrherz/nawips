		     NAWIPS 5.7.x  CHANGE DESCRIPTION LOG

	( * indicates a change that makes this version of NAWIPS
	    incompatible with the previous version )


01.	ASCII Decoders  	

1	a. T118:  Added the ability to decode and display Joint Typhoon Warning
	   Center (JTWC) hurricane warning products with the product id:
	   WTPN3[1-5] PGTW.  AH, (DK), 10/16/03.

1	a-1. Created a new FORTRAN routine to take input from GPKGRF and create
	     a text file for use by WWA.  Created two new C subroutines to convert
	     strings of UG county and marine zones into arrays which then are
	     formatted into a UG line and to create the WFO string from a list
	     of WFOs. MG and AH, (DK), 10/22/03.

1	a-2. Fixed problem report 695 Decode 1 - 5 and Display 1. Added the
	     suggestion to increase variables, tadnm*2 and wadnm(ii)*2, to *3 in 
	     gghrcn.  Modified the decoding of the JTWC reports so that bulletins
	     with missing header lines or extra lines in the header will be 
	     decoded.  Fixed decoding of corrected/amended reports.  Removed the 
	     'A' character from the decoded advisory number.  Fixed the display 
	     for storms with a 100 kt wind in the initial time period.  The wind 
	     radii will be plotted in the maroon color instead of blue.  AH, 
	     (DK), 11/18/03.

1	a-3. Fixed problem report 706 Decode 1 - 2.  Modified the decoding of the
	     JTWC reports so that bulletins with latitude less than 10 degrees 
	     have the longitude correctly decoded.  Also, fixed the ability to 
	     decode corrected JTWC named tropical storms and depressions. 
	     Previously, this type of bulletin was skipped.  AH, (SJ), 12/1/03.

1	a-4. Modified TPC graphic program GPKGRF to automatically generate a
	     tropical cyclone breakpoint watch/warning text message for each 
	     Atlantic storm which has breakpoint information.  This is an 
	     experimental product only.  DK, (SJ), 12/4/03.

1	a-5. Fixed problem report 715:Decode 1.  Modified the hurricane decoder, 
	     DCHRCN, to use the 'current' time to help create the full GEMPAK 
	     date/time string when decoding JTWC files when running in batch 
	     mode.  AH, (SJ), 12/5/03.

1	a-6. Bug fix, 720, for TPC graphic program GPKGRF - added close
	     statements for breakpoint files used to create the tropical cyclone 
	     breakpoint watch/warning text message.  DK, (AH), 12/8/03.

1	a-7. Fixed problem report 724:Decode 1.  Initialized the date/time
	     string for JTWC messages in DCHRCN.  AH, (DK), 12/8/03.

1	a-8. Changed help for TPC graphic program GPKGRF to include information
	     about breakpoint file naming conventions and usage.  DK, (AH), 
	     12/9/03.

2	a-9. Modified TPC graphic program GPKGRF for the 2004 hurricane season
	     in response to TPC requests: improved breakpoint display in Caribbean
	     region; allowed more breakpoint options for Chesapeake Bay, Tidal 
	     Potomac and Delaware Bay; allowed multiple warnings for bays, rivers
	     and lakes; added direction of movement, TPC attribution line, and 
	     intensity info to legend box; added letter showing intensity to 
	     forecast points.  DK, (SJ), 1/29/04.

2	a-10. Added a new element TCA into vgstruct.h.  BY, (ES), 2/11/04.

2	a-11. Created the structures and cvg routines in order to read and
	      write the new element TCA.  BY, (ES), 2/13/04.

2	a-12. Added new breakpoint table and corresponding clo.tbl entry to
	      be used for new TCA GUI.  DK, (SJ), 2/17/04.

2	a-13. Release notes for tropical cyclone graphics.  DK, (SJ), 2/19/04.

2	a-14. Created the cds and gh routines in order to display TCA elements.
	      BY, (ES), 2/25/04.

2	a-15. Modified TPC graphic program GPKGRF to fix an error in the WMO
	      header for the tropical cyclone watch/warning breakpoint text
	      message and to add an 'E' ("experimental") at the start of the
	      VTEC line.  DK, (SJ), 2/25/04.

2	a-16. Updates and corrections to new breakpoint table to be used with new
	      TCA GUI.  (Cuba and Puerto Rico are now specified as point pairs.)
	      Cleanup of official breakpoint table and prolog of gh_bkhi.  
	      DK, (AH), 2/26/04.

2	a-17. Fixed bugs in the creation of the tropical cyclone watch/warning 
	      text message when the WFO ATTN string or the UGC county/marine zone
	      string was too long.  DK, (SJ), 3/11/04.

3	a-18. Graphical Interface to Choose Break Points.  Fixed a bug mentioned 
	      in test# 752 observatin 2.  BY, (ES), 3/24/04.

3	a-19. Modified new breakpoint table to simplify coding of breakpoint 
	      plotting routines for program GPTCWW, currently under development.
	      DK, (SJ), 3/24/04.

3	a-20. Graphical interface to choose breakpoints.  Added the area number
	      as an output parameter of function gh_bksq.  BY, (ES), 3/31/04.

3	a-21. Graphical interface to choose breakpoints.  Modified cdstca.c to
	      handle the case station ID has less than 8 characters.  This fixed
	      bug 758:P1.  BY, (ES), 4/8/04.

3	a-22. Modified GPKGRF (tropical cyclone watch/warning graphic) to check
	      for and correct the problem where storms in the far eastern
	      Atlantic would occasionally overplot the NOAA logo.  Added
	      parameter option to bypass creation of the watch/warning text
	      message.  (Default is to create the message.)  Allowed variable
	      number of forecast intensity definition lines in legend, to reduce
	      size of legend box.  DK, (SJ), 4/19/04.

3	a-23. Fixed the code which generates the tropical cyclone watch/warning
	      text message to properly handle the case of two (or more) 
	      breakpoints falling on the same UGC (county or marine zone) 
	      boundary.  (Two instances of this occur with the official
	      breakpoints.  More will occur when the standard/supplemental 
	      breakpoints are introduced.)  DK, (SJ), 4/20/04.

3	a-24. Fixed PR: 761:P1.  Added the functionality necessary to enable the
	      TCA GUI to create TCA elements.  BY, (ES), 5/3/04.

3	a-25. Created a new program, GPTCWW, which reads a VG file of tropical
	      cyclone watch/warning breakpoint information and use it to plot the
	      tropical cyclone watch/warning graphic.  Added several new gh
	      routines, called by GPTCWW, which are based on existing ones.  MG,
	      (DK), 5/5/04.

3	a-26. The TcaFileInfo structure was only able to hold 3 segments at most.
	      This delivery dynamically allocated a string to hold TCA attributes
	      so that more than 3 TCA segments could be created.  Also, fixed a
	      bug in ghbkpl.f.  BY, (ES), 5/11/04.
	      
3	a-27. Release notes for the TCA element.  ES, (SJ), 5/11/04.

3	a-28. Set 'Atlantic' as the default basin; Added gh_ftbl in cds_tca to 
	      free the table and fixed other memory related problems in 
	      nmap_pgtca.c; Fixed the bug when deleting a tca segment in the 
	      middle of the list; Modified the TCA element output format in 
	      cvgdump.  BY, (ES), 5/14/04.

3	a-29. Modified ghtcww.f to make the VGF file name consistent with the 
	      file name convention used by NMAP2.  Fixes TRP #767.  
	      MG, (DK), 5/17/04.

3	a-30. Clarified an error message for opening the breakpoint file.  
	      Updated track error tables for the 2004 hurricane season based on 
	      info received from TPC.  DK, MM, (SJ), 5/17/04.

3	a-31. Fixed problem 1, 3, 4, 6 and suggestion 1 and 2 in test report 766.
	      BY, (ES), 5/18/04.

3	a-32. There were two stations with the same name in the breakpoint table.
	      This delivery changed one of them from San_Felipe to San_Felipe_W.
	      nmap_pgtca.c was modified to handle blank station ids.  
	      BY, (ES), 5/19/04.

3	a-33. Changed 'Matagorda Island' to 'Matagorda_Island' in the break point
	      table.  Added deselect function in the TCA segment list box.  Added
	      code in nmap_pgtca.c to redraw handlebars after creating VG files.
	      BY, (ES), 5/24/04.

3	a-34. Corrected a bug in the gg library which was causing storm name 
	      labels for active eastern Pacific and western Pacific (JTWC) storms
	      to be plotted erroneously when the central Pacific (CPHC) tropical 
	      cyclone danger area marine graphic was plotted.  DK, (SJ), 5/26/04.

3	a-35. Modified nmap_pgtca.c to check the storm name and the valid time 
	      seperately.  BY, (ES), 5/26/04.

3	a-36. Fixed bug in hurricane decoder DCHRCN in which the year '03' had 
	      been hard-coded into the storm id field (e.g., ep0103) for storms 
	      from the JTWC.  (Found by CDB.)  DK, (SJ), 5/28/04.

3	a-37. Enlarged the range of tca segments in order to select them easily 
	      by mouse clicks.  BY, (ES), 6/1/04.

3	a-38. This release contains the corrected release notes for the TCA 
	      element.  ES, (SJ), 6/2/04.

3	a-39. Corrected spelling of Suwannee River in breakpoint tables per 2004 
	      tropical cyclone directive.  DK, (SJ), 6/8/04.

3	a-40. The decode and display of hurricane advisories was modified to 
	      handle a change which the JTWC introduced effective June 1, 2004.
	      JTWC advisories before that date reported the radius of maximum 
	      wind at 100 kt; after that date, the radius is reported at 64 kt.
	      (64 kt is consistent with the value used by TPC and CPHC.)   The 
	      decoder was also modified to only decode western Pacific advisories
	      from the JTWC.  Eastern and central Pacific storms will be decoded 
	      from TPC and CPHC advisories, respectively.  DK, (SJ), 6/8/04.

3	a-41. This release contains the updated release notes for the TCA element.
	      ES, (SJ), 6/9/04.

4	a-42. Added functionality to the 'Break Point Type' option menu and the 
	      'Special Geography' option menu.  BY, (ES), 7/12/04.

4	a-43. Added forecast hour flags in order to display HRCN based on the 
	      flag setting.  BY, (FY), 7/19/04.

4	a-44. Simplified the GH_BKTB routine, removing  code dealing with user 
	      screen queries in program GPTCWW.	 Modified GH_BKPP routine so that,
	      given two endpoints, it will only plot supplemental points if they 
	      are endpoints, otherwise the supplemental points are not plotted.  
	      Also, modified the argument to GLINE routine that plots Matagorda 
	      Island.  Made sure that changes to ghcmn.cmn and tcabkpt.tbl do not
	      affect adversely the execution of NMAP2, GPGKRF, GPTPC.  MG, (DK), 
	      7/20/04.

4	a-45. Changed the length of the string used in the drag box to hold the 
	      station names.  BY, (ES), 7/20/04.

4	a-46. Added two calls to xgtoff() in nmap_pgtca.c in order to select 
	      segments by mouse clicks in roaming modes.  BY, (ES), 7/27/04.

4	a-47. Changed the internal structure that stores TCA elements.  The 
	      previous structure can hold only two break points for one segment. 
	      In order to handle water and islands, the two-element array is 
	      changed to a pointer.  All routines that deal with TCA are modified
	      to allocate and then free the break point memory.  BY, (ES), 
	      8/10/04.

4	a-48. Moved the routine pgtca_freeBkpts from pgen to cvg.  BY, (ES),
	      8/12/04.

4	a-49. Added release notes for Filter display of HRCN data by FORECAST 
	      hour.  FY, (SJ), 8/30/04.

4	a-50. Modified GPTCWW so that it can plot watches and warnings for 
	      islands and bodies of water.  Also, modified a subroutine cdstca.c,
	      to make NMAP2 plot watches/warnings for the same areas.  MG, 
	      (DK), 8/31/04.

4	a-51. Modified a subroutine used to create the tropical cyclone 
	      watch/warning text message so that if the user selects a 
	      supplemental breakpoint, the UGC counties and zones for the nearest
	      official breakpoint will be used.  This does not affect the 
	      functionality of the current program GPKGRF, which only uses 
	      official breakpoints, but will be used with the new gui-based text 
	      message creation code now under development.  DK, (SJ), 9/1/04.

4	a-52. Added new functions to create TCA text message in NMAP2.  Fixed the
	      island handle bars and the drag box problem ( reported in 12.2.2 
	      test report).  Fixed the invalid memory bug in the arrow callback 
	      routine in NMAP2 (reported in 12.2.2 test report). BY, (ES), 9/1/04.

4	a-53. Release notes for tasks 12.3 and 12.5 (combined):  experimental 
	      hurricane graphics program.  DK, (TP), 9/1/04.

4	a-54. Release notes for the TCA project.  ES, (SJ), 9/3/04.

4	a-55. This is a short update to the TCA release notes.  ES, (TP), 9/3/04.

4	a-56. Modified nmap_pgtca.c to limit the storm number to two digits. In 
	      the previous delivery, the storm number can be four digits and it 
	      doesn't generate the text message when the storm number exceeds two 
	      digits.  This fixes 1a-52:O2 above.  BY, (ES), 9/7/04.

4	a-57. Eliminated all duplicate station names for supplemental and 
	      official breakpoints by postfixing the state abbreviation.  DK, 
	      (SJ), 9/7/04.

4	a-58. Small correction to TCA release notes.  ES, (TP), 9/7/04.

4	a-59. In response to a problem discovered by the TPC, added a point to 
	      the Cuba section of the official breakpoint table so that watches 
	      and warnings for Guantanamo province will be plotted correctly.  
	      DK, (SJ), 9/9/04.

1	b. T012:  Added the decoding of Canadian domestic and international
	   SIGMETs to DCISIG.  LLWS and WNDSHR (Low level wind shear) have been
	   added to the phenomenon list that DCISIG decodes.  Only the first
	   phenomenon encountered from the list in IS_PHEN will be decoded in a
	   Canadian SIGMET.  NMAP2 and GPMAP have been modified to plot LLWS
	   (low level wind shear) and to allow for flight levels of SFC and
	   FZLVL.   Added four stations to intlsig.tbl.  FY, (SJ), 11/5/03.

1	b-1. Fixed P.R.N. 698 so that DCISIG would decode the cancel message
	     for CWTO B8 in 2003110511.intl by checking for a false "SIGMET"
	     header keyword that appeared in the text of the message.  FY,
	     (SJ), 11/18/03.

1	b-2. Added release note information about decoding Canadian SIGMETs.
	     FY, (SJ), 11/18/03.

1	b-3. Fixed problem report number 707:  Two similar Canadian SIGMETS were
	     not decoded.  Enhance and Fix DCISIG:   Fined tuned the decoding of 
	     Canadian SIGMETS by adding more key words, checking for some false 
	     key words, and increasing length limit for searches.  Added 
	     phenomenon "WV/SHR".  Merged subroutines IS_TC and IS_HURC into 
	     IS_TCHU in the International SIGMET decoder DCISIG.  Fixed handling 
	     of missing values for max winds and pressure.  NMAP2 and GPMAP have 
	     been modified to plot max winds and pressure fields for hurricanes, 
	     tropical storms, and typhoons.  Fixed the decoding of a missing 
	     vertex for some MUHA SIGMETS.  Added one station to intlsig.tbl.
	     FY, (SJ), 12/5/03.

1	b-4. Modified release note about decoding Canadian SIGMETs and noted 
	     changes to decoding tropical disturbances.  FY, (SJ), 12/8/03.

1	b-5. Fixed problem report number 723:  Six Canadian international
	     SIGMETs issued from CYQX on 12/08/03 were not decoded.  Modified
	     DCISIG to allow for no slashes in the area definition of a
	     Canadian SIGMET.  Searched for " END/" in a Canadian SIGMET to end 
	     phenomenon search to avoid possible initials being picked up as 
	     phenomenon.  FY, (DK), 12/9/03.

2	b-6. Modified NMAP2 to allow for the option of encoding area definitions
	     using VOR points when generating (Alaskan) International SIGMETs.
	     FY, (SJ), 1/29/04.

2	b-7. Modified DCISIG for enhancements and bug fixes to the International
	     SIGMET Decoder, especially for variations in Canadian SIGMETS.
	     FY, (SJ), 2/12/04.

2	b-8. Fixed problem valgrind found when running DCISIG by shortening the 
	     length of the string in REPORT in the call to ST_PRSL in subroutine 
	     IS_CNAR.  FY, 9SJ), 3/4/04.

1	c. T280:  Transitioned to GFS-based MOS.  MG, (DK), 11/17/03.

1	c-1. Added new stations to GFS MOS station table.  MG, (DK), 11/18/03.

1	c-2. Added four new stations to GFS MOS station table. DK, (SJ), 11/26/03.

2	c-3. Removed embedded blanks in station names for KFST, KLOT, KOUN, 
	     KVBC and KWMC.  DK, (SJ), 12/22/03.

2	c-4. Modified GFS MOS decoder DCGMOS and packing table to handle changes 
	     to input sky cover, ceiling height and visibility scheduled for 
	     May 18, 2004  (per TIN 04-09).  DK, (SJ), 3/5/04.

3	c-5. Modified GEMPAK documentation for changes made by MDL (effective 
	     5/18/04) in the definitions of GFS MOS table values for parameters 
	     FCIG (categorical forecast of ceiling height conditions) and FVSA 
	     (categorical forecast of visibility conditions).  See TIN 04-09 for 
	     details.  (Required code changes, transparent to the user, were 
	     made in release 5.7.2).  DK, (SJ), 5/14/04.

1	d. T150:  Modified the winter storm message display routine to handle 
	   certain kinds of corrected winter storm reports.  ML, (DK), 11/18/03.

2	e. T148:  Modified the convective sigmet decoder, DCCSIG, to decode NIL 
	   type reports.  Also, modified the display of convective sigmets and 
	   outlooks to only display the last issuance for each region and that 
	   they appear immediately and remain only as long as there is no nil 
	   issuance for that particular region (west, central, east).  
	   AH, (SJ), 1/12/04.

3	e-1. Corrected the error file from 'DCCIG' to 'DCCSIG'.  Added error 
	     checking for finding the convective sigmets and the outlook sigmets.
	     AH, (DK), 5/24/04.

3	e-2. Expanded and corrected release note for using GG_CSIG to display the
	     extrapolated 1 and 2 hour forecasts.  FY, (SS), 6/4/04.

3	e-3. Modified NMAP2 and GPMAP to plot extrapolated 1-hour and 2-hour 
	     convective SIGMETs (CSIG) in additon to the initial (0-hour) CSIG 
	     that is currently plotted.  FY, (SJ), 6/9/04.

3	e-4. Fixed problem report 783.  A bug in GG_CSIG, unrelated to 
	     extrapolation was discovered while testing the display of 
	     extrapolated CSIG forecasts.  When running TESTGG, the program had 
	     segmentation faults if the end time was entered as "all".  When "all"
	     was entered, sometimes arrays were indexed higher than they were 
	     dimensioned by parameter NW (=1000).  So, NW was increased and a 
	     check was added for the index prior to incrementing it.  FY, (TP), 
	     6/15/04.


2	f. T306:  A problem with the metar decoder, DCMETR, which was reported in
	   the SDM log on December 26, 2003 was fixed.  A bulletin fragment which
           began with the characters 'SPUR PA' had caused subsequent PMSL data
           not to be stored.  The return code for bad headers are now being
           checked.  Lengths of errstr in calls to DC_WLOG have been fixed.
           The metar decoder, DCMETR and the TAF decoder, DCTAF have been updated 
           with changes that DMQA Branch made in 2001, but were never ported to
           our library.  These changes corrected some deficiencies and allowed 
           decoding of more data by checking for a 'P' or 'M' indicator for
           visibilities encoded in meters, checking for the max wind indicator
           'P', and checking for the max gust indicator 'GP'.  Possible slashes 
           in the visibility, weather, and sky fields were handled.  Fixed some
           bugs in these changes.  Added release note.  FY, (DK), 3/2/04.

2	g. T228:  Ported bug fixes from DMQAB for decoder DCACFT which decodes 
	   RECCO reports.  Corrected the decoding of aircraft altitudes of 10,000
	   meters or more and the decoding of dew points less than or equal to 
	   -50 degrees C.  CC-M, FY, (DK), 3/4/04.

	g-1. Modified the aircraft decoder, DCACFT, to check for and eliminate
	     duplicate reports. The duplicates are decoded, but are not written
	     to the output GEMPAK file.  SD, (SJ), 5/3/04.

3	h. T314:  DCSVRL (SLS) decoder bug report 3/1/04.  Improved the handling 
	   of OUTLINE FOR (outline type) line in the MND header of the Areal 
	   Outline text Product (SLS).  MG, (AH), 3/24/04.


02.	GRIB Decoder

1	a. T155:  Fixed bug with Probability of Precipitation introduced with new
	   CPC probability logic.  TP, (SJ), 10/29/03.

3	a-1. Added more info to NDFDG2 error # +4.  CB, (SJ), 6/2/04.

4	b. Changed parameter VERCEN to CENTER in ndfdinp.f.  TP, (AH), 7/14/04.

4	b-1. Reconciled changes made in this delivery with the changes made by 
	     Chris Bailey.  Note:  CSC is due to an argument never used by 
	     ndfdpds.f or gd2ndfd.f.  TP, (SJ), 9/7/04.

4	c. Modifications to the function NDFDLCC codes converts negative 
	   longitudes into positive values and the latitude at the south pole is 
	   set to -90.  The Shape of the Earth is also made consistant with the 
	   rest of GEMPAK.  The NDFDPDS function encodes GRIB2 section 4 and was 
	   changed to include the forecast interval end time for templates 4.8 
	   and 4.9, the generating process ID, statistical process number if 
	   required, and correct values.  Modifications to gd2ndfd.pdf fixes the 
	   discrepancy between the file where CENTER is specified but VERCEN is 
	   expected in the function NDFDINP.  The change allows the user to input
	   the center and sub-center id numbers without them being ignored by the
	   program.  In addition, the generating process ID can be entered as the
	   third number which will be sent to NDFDPDS.  The main program gd2ndfd.f
	   is modified to handle the new calling sequences and the generating 
	   process ID.  CB, (SJ), 8/30/04.

03.	BUFR (T002)

1	a. This is the phase I delivery for creating JET in PGEN.  JW,
	   (DP), 10/27/03.

1	a-1. Developed a new table-driven encoder program BUFRENC which reads
	     user input parameters, tables and ASCII file to produce one or
	     more BUFR output files.  ML, DK, (DK), 11/4/03.

1	a-2. Added new BUFR descriptor tables and master table to be used by
	     BUFR encoder program BUFRENC.  DK, (SJ), 11/12/03.

1	a-3. Fixed several problems in test report #699 - BUFRENC problems.
	     ML, (DK), 11/17/03.

1	a-4. Created a new function cvg_snapjet() in the CVG library. This
	     new function adjusts the geographical locations of all wind
	     barb, text, and hash mark jet sub-elements to the nearest
	     location on the jet line. Also, wind barb and text are rotated
	     tangent to the jet line; hash marks are rotated perpendicular.
	     RT, (DP), 11/18/03.

1	a-5. Changed call cgr_dang() to call clo_direct() in order to avoid
	     device dependency. Also add more checks.  RT, (DP), 11/21/03.

1	a-6. Phase II delivery for creating JET in PGEN.  A user can add/move/
	     delete barbs and hashs to a jet line through a new jet editing 
	     window. Also, user can edit the attributes of the jet line, the 
	     barbs, and the hashs.  JW, (DP), 11/21/03.

1	a-7. Allow proper MOVE/COPY actions on the JET element.  JW, (DP),
	     11/24/03.

1	a-8. Revised the initial jet creation GUI to a more compact form.  Also
	     made addtional changes to facilitate the GUI changes.  JW, (DP),
	     12/2/03.

1	a-9. Used the same color to draw a barb and its associated flight level
	     text on JET line.  The text's color always changes with its
	     associated barb's color.  JW, (DP), 12/3/03.

1	a-10. Fixed bugs in test report #709:P1, P2, S1, & S2 - zero length
	      BUFR output, wrong indexing problems in BUFRENC.  ML, (DK), 12/8/03.

1	a-11. Fixed the JET problems as described in T716:P1 and T716:P2.  JW,
	      (DP), 12/8/03.

2	a-12. Fixed the problem T733:P2 - the JET color pallette could remain
	      up after exiting product generation. Also fixed the similar
	      problem existing for other VG elements, including front, wind,
	      sigmet, list, and vac.  JW, (SJ), 12/22/03.

2	a-13. Improved the EXTRAP operation by: (1) keeping the EXTRAP window 
	      up as long as the operation mode is "FUNC_EXTRAP". Previously, the 
	      EXTRAP window pops down after an UNDO operation even though the 
	      operation mode is "FUNC_EXTRAP", thus the user has to re-click the 
	      "EXTRAP" button to brings up the window.  (2) allowing the 
	      extrapolation of the jet barbs and hashs.  Previously, only the jet 
	      line is extrapolated. The barbs and hashs are simply snapped onto 
	      the new jet line without extrapolation, which is not correct.  
	      JW, (SJ), 12/24/03.
	
2	a-14. Fixed a jet display problem where the jet barbs/hashs may not fall 
	      on the jet line if the map projection changes.  JW, (DP), 1/5/04.

2	a-15. Fixed bug in test report #727:P1 - seg faulted when bufrenc is used
	      to encode bufr files sequentially.  ML, (DK), 1/20/04.

2	a-16. Bug (not reported) fix to rotation of wind barbs and hash marks
	      during snapping of jet element. Rotation was not correct at high
	      latitudes in CED projections.  DP, (SJ), 2/2/04.

2	a-17. Minor changes to the way the new jet element plots it's wind barbs
	      and text, i.e., 1) center the wind barb at the snapped location,
	      2) use filled flags on the barb, 3) center the text at the snapped 
	      location, 4) adjust the text above or below the jet line based on 
	      the wind barb's snapped latitude.  DP, (SJ), 2/5/04.

2	a-18. Fixed bug in test report #738:P1 - Memory leak on linux2.4el
	      when bufrenc is used to encode bufr files sequentially.  ML,
	      ES, (DK), 2/5/04.

2	a-19. Added delta flight level information into JET element. Also
	      adjusted the plot position for this flight level text change.
	      JW, (DP), 2/9/04.

2	a-20. Fixed a bug reported by AWC -- the BUFRENC generated JUVE00* files
	       are slightly different in some values from the operational verion.
	       Also fixed  memory leak problem when running BUFRENC with a single
	       FXY table input.  ML, (DK), 2/18/04.

2	a-21. Remove device dependency when rotating and snapping, specifically 
	      the inverted y-coordinates of certain drivers.  This fixes the 
	      (unreported) problem of plotting the jet element using the PS 
	      driver.  DP, (SJ), 2/25/04.

2	a-22. Set a few invalid entry checks for jet flight level information:
	      (1) if input speed < 80, set equal to 80; if > 400, set to 400.
	      (2) if input level is blank, set to 300; if > 1000, set to 1000.
	      (3) if one input delta is blank, set to 0.  (4) if both input 
	      deltas are blank, set to 0 and do not plot the delta information.  
	      Also, when editing flight level information, the window keeps up 
	      until the user hits "Cancel" or clicks middle mouse.  Orginally, 
	      "Apply" button will dismiss the window.  JW, (DP), 3/2/04.

2	a-23. Modified program SIGWXCNV, which converts a high-level
	      significant weather chart from VGF to ASCII format, so that it
	      will handle the new jet element, creating ASCII output in the same
	      format as is currently generated for the jet group.  ML, (DK),
	      3/4/04.

2	a-24. Set the maximum flight level to 999 and formatted the flight level 
	      text as FL###.  If the flight level is less than 10, it is 
	      displayed as“FL00#.  If it is less than 100, it is displayed as 
	      “FL0##.  JW, (DP), 3/8/04

3	a-25. Added text offset controls in JET's“Barb Info GUI.  The text 
	      position now can be conveniently changed via a set of arrow buttons.
	      The rules are:  default text placement as current; arrows result in
	      text movement relative to the text rotation; central buttons resets
	      to default position; whenever a barb is moved, text placement 
	      returns to the default position.  JW, (DP), 3/25/04.

3	a-26. Modified SIGWXCNV and SIGAVGF to agree with UKMET codes:
	      1) Modified the ASCII file so that cloud definition points are
	      given counterclockwise, not clockwise.  2) Adjusted the front
	      movement written to the ASCII file by 180 degrees. 3) Converted
	      the front speed written to the ASCII file from knots to m/s.
	      Also, fixed a bug for SIGWXCNV of a close flipped cloud line
	      becoming open line after running SIGWXCNV.  ML, (DK), 3/31/04.
 
3	a-27. Fixed the problem for the missing pixmaps on the jet barb
	      information window. Originally, when selecting a jet barb to pop up
	      the barb information window, the set of buttons used to move the
	      barb text displayed with blank pixmaps, which were supposed to
	      display as arrows.  JW, (DP), 3/31/04.

3	a-28. Fixed problem T756:P1 -- deleting a jet barb after moving its
	      associated text may propogate the deleted barb's text offset to
	      next barb. T756:P2 could be resolved with the pgen action
	      "Refresh".  JW, (DP), 4/19/04.

3	a-29. Added flight level deltas for Jet element for SIGWXCNV, BUFRENC,
	      and SIGBUFR.  Fixed an unrelated bug for assigning the turbulence
	      category in SIGWXCNV, and included some miscellaneous cleanup in
	      the bfr library.  ML, (DK), 4/20/04.

3	a-30. Modified the mapping of SWH (high-level significant weather)
	      turbulence codes from VG to ASCII and back to VG to be consistent
	      with values used by the UKMET.  ML, (DK), 4/21/04.

3	a-31. Added entries for jet barb color,  barb width , and hash color in
	      the setting.tbl and uattribd.tbl to allow user control of these 
	      attributes.  Also added GUI control of clearing of the jet barbs 
	      via the barb width.  JW, (DP), 5/7/04.

3	a-32. Changes BUFRENC encoder to use a replication factor of 1 for 
	      volcano pionts as UKMET.  ML, (DK), 5/12/04.

3	a-33. Created a new table-driven GEMPAK program VG2UKA to convert 
	      high-level significant weather(SWH) VG files to ASCII ouput in the 
	      UKMET browable format.  The program takes as input a VG file, 
	      GEMPAK date/time, forecast hour, originating center id, and chart 
	      type/alias.  ML, (DK), 6/7/04.

3	a-34. Fixed test report #785 - problem 1, 2, 3, 4 and observation 1 for 
	      the new  GEMPAK program VG2UKA.  ML, (DK), 6/15/04.

3	a-35. Increased size of character variable for RADIATION in program 
	      VG2UKA.  DK, (TP), 6/17/04.

3	a-36. Revised help file for new GEMPAK program VG2UKA.  Added help for 
	      Product Generation  - BUFR.  DK, (SJ), 6/17/04.

4	a-37. Change the command line program SIGAVGF, which converts SIGWX data 
	      from the UKMET browsable ASCII format to a VG file, so that it will
	      create the jets portion of the VG file using the new jet element 
	      instead of the grouped jet.  Grouped jets will no longer be created
	      by SIGAVGF.  Because the new jet element will be used instead, 
	      flight deltas can now be included in the VG file which is created 
	      by SIGAVGF.  ML, (DK), 7/7/04.

4	a-38. Modify GEMPAK program VG2UKA to change the way in which wind speeds
	      are assigned to hash marks, and to assign flight level (but not 
	      flight level deltas) to hash marks.  ML, (DK), 7/19/04.

4	a-39. Fixed seg fault problem when running SIGAVGF to convert jet 
	      elements from the UKMET browsable ASCII format to a VG file, also 
	      fixed the incorrect group type problem as stated in above test 
	      report.  ML, (DK), 7/19/04.

4	a-40. Added an ability for VG2UKA to convert a mid level significant 
	      weather chart (SWM) VG file to ASCII file.  ML, (DK), 8/18/04.

4	a-41. Modified the way in which wind speed values are assigned to jet 
	      line hash marks for SigWx charts in program VG2UKA, based on 
	      updated information received from the AWC on how to handle error 
	      cases.  DK, (SJ), 8/30/04.

4	a-42. Fixed a bug for  VG2UKA when both BKN and OVC were selected as the 
	      cloud amount as described above.  Also modified the output format 
	      according to UKMET samples.  ML, (DK), 9/1/04.

4	a-43. Release notes for task 6.1:  converted new jet element from ASCII 
	      to VGF.  DK, (TP), 9/1/04.

4	a-44. Release notes for task 6.3:  changed hash mark speed and flight 
	      level assignment for jets.  DK, (TP), 9/1/04.


04.	GEMLIB Changes

1	a. Updated to 5.7.1.  TP, (TP), 10/6/03.

1	b. T249:  Add an ablity for QSCT to display high-resolution data and
	   SEAWIND data.  ML, (SJ), 10/8/03.

2	b-1. Fixed problem in test report #660:O1. When 0.0 was set for the
	     time interval of QSCT data, the default value of 30 was used for
	     plotting, while the value was still 0.0 in the attribute box.
	     ML, (SJ), 12/22/03.

3	b-2. Modified GG_QSRD to read the changed HI-RES QSCT data, which no 
	     longer has a file name record and changed the criteria for swapping 
	     bytes.  Also, fixed bug which displayed circles when using the 
	     second color for rain.  FY, (SJ), 5/24/04.

3	b-3. Allowed the plotting of QuikScat data as arrows and directional 
	     arrows in addition to the current plotting as barbs.  Removed SEAWND
	     and SEAWND_HI processing.  FY, (SJ), 6/3/04.

4	b-4. Modified NMAP2 and GPMAP to allow plotting of QuikScat ambiguity 
	     data.  Allowed for lower case entry of QSCT file type (such as qsct 
	     and qsct_hi)  in GPMAP and TESTGG.  Fixed a bug in displaying the 
	     second color bar for QSCT rain data.  FY, (SJ), 7/27/04.

2	c. Updated to 5.7.2.  TP, (TP), 12/22/03.

2	d. T305:  Added two new functions in the ER library - er_gnumerr and
	    er_gerrmsg, which allow us to remove ercmn.h from all functions
	    external to the ER library and move ercmn.h back to the ER library.
	    The maximum number of error messages in the buffer was also increased
	    to 100.  JW, (SJ), 1/12/04.

2	d-1. Changed the parameter "index" in er_gerrmsg from type "int" to 
	     "int *", which allows both C and Fortran to use this function.
	     JW, (SJ), 2/9/04.

2	e.  T309:  Changed the data resolution and number of bits used for storage
	    for the wind speed in upper air data. The values are set in the file
	    creation file for files with the various "parts" saved separately.
	    Changed the resolution to save the value to the nearest 0.01 m/s.
	    SJ, (DK), 2/9/04.

3	f. Updated to 5.7.3.  TP, (TP), 3/24/04.

3	g. Modified the pc library to allow the specification  of '=M' as a 
	   parameter condition.   This will denote a missing value, so that, for
	   example, the specification SFPARM=MARK:16;VSBY=M will plot an X when
	   the visibility value is missing.  DK, (SJ), 4/23/04.

3	h. T315:  Added 3 new surface pressure parameters: PANY, RANY and SANY:
	   (1)  PANY--Returns PMSL if available, if not, returns ALTM if
	   available.  (2)  RANY--Computes the abbreviated 3 digit display of
	   pressure.  (3)  SANY  Takes a real and converts the integral part
	   into a 3 character string.  SC & AH, (SJ), 5/11/04.

3	i. T316:  Added two new grid diagnostics--PLCL and TLCL.  PLCL--Computes
	   the pressure of the lifting condensation level (LCL).  TLCL--Computes
	   the temperature of the lifting condensation level.  SC & AH, (SJ),
	   4/11/04.

4	j. Updated to 5.7.4.  TP, (TP), 7/7/04.


05.	CGEMLIB Changes

1	a. T014:  Added the ability to skip commented lines in lpfs.  AH, (SJ),
	   10/30/03.

1	a-1. Changed the maximum number of layers from 10 to 20.  ES, (SJ),
	     11/5/03.

1	a-2. Changed the maximum number of layers from 10 to 20 and corrected the
	     11/04 delivery by removing the MAX_LAYER definition from ctbcmn.h 
	     and moving the MAX_LAYERS definition from pgprm.h to gemprm.h.  
	     ES, (SJ), 11/6/03.

1	a-3. Added release note information about adding layers 11-20 to pgen.
	     ES, (SJ), 11/12/03.

1	a-4. Added a Save All function to product generation.  Save All is only
	     available when layering is up.  ES, (DP), 11/18/03.

1	a-5. Part II of the Save All project.  An .lpf file can now contain an 
	     output file.  If any layer does have an output file, it can be saved 
	     without doing an initial Save As.  ES, (SJ), 11/21/03.

1	a-6. Fixed a problem in loading .lpf files containing the new output file
	     tags.  ES, (SJ), 11/24/03.

1	a-7. Fixed a compiler warning in the nmap_pglayrw.c directory.  Two
	     functions were declared as static in the local prototype but the 
	     functions themselves were not declared static.  ES, (SJ), 12/5/03.

1	b. T290:  New code in the CGR library. These tools will be needed by the 
	   new 'smear' algorithm.  Two new functions appear in TESTCGR:  1) 
	   CGR_REORDER, which re-orders polygons counter-clockwise starting with 
	   the point with the greatest x-value, 2) CGR_POLYUNION, which takes two 
	   intersecting polygons and returns the union polygon. DP, (SJ), 11/6/03.

1	b-1. Routines for union, link and smear of graphical objects - 
	     1) cgr_polyunion, 2) cgr_polylink, and 3) cgr_polysmear.  DP, (SJ),
	     11/24/03.

1	b-2. Uncomment one line in the general polygon processing (a return code).
	     DP, (SJ), 11/24/03.

1	b-3. Bug fix in cgrpoly - remove code from polyp_getpts that checks for
	     and removes duplicate points (or points that are very close 
	     together).  This checking is not required in this function and was 
	     not required by any of the calling routines.  DP, (SJ), 12/3/03.

1	b-4. Added the GUI to support the SMEAR function.  Smear takes one or
	     more closed figures (sigmets, airmets, or closed lines) and creates a
	     new element combining the selected figures.  ES, (SJ), 12/4/03.

1	b-5. Enhancements and a bug fix to the smear action algorithm.  1) Fixed 
	     bug which caused occasional hanging or seg fault depending on 
	     platform.  This was happening when one or more sections of the 
	     original polygons were exactly equal.  Added a test for equality.  
	     2) Enhancements:  a) Map co-linear segments when number of mapping 
	     points is zero, b) Mapping sections with equal number of points get 
	     mapped one-to-one, c) Mapping sections with unequal number of points
	     (both non-zero) get mapped point-to-point whenever possible.  d) 
	     Mapping sections with one section containing zero points to map get 
	     mapped the old way.  DP, (SJ), 12/5/03.

1	b-6. Fixed PR: 722, when in class ANY smear can select the wrong 
	     element types.  ES, (SJ), 12/8/03.

1	b-7. Fixed PR: 725, a problem with mouse hint messages which showed up
	     after a smear was completed.  ES, (AH), 12/9/03.

1	b-8. Fixed PR:  728 for smear problem found in UNION function.
	     DP, (ES), 12/9/03.

1	b-9. Fixed one more issue with PR: 725, a problem with mouse hint
	     messages that shows up when clicking on non-smearable elements.
	     ES, (SJ), 12/10/03.

1	b-10. Fixed one more issue with smear, where nmap2 crashes when
	      attempting to smear a 2 point area sigmet.  ES, (SJ), 12/10/03.

1	b-11. Additional changes/ bug fix for smear and union.  DP, (SJ),
	      12/11/03.

2	b-12. Airmet/Sigmet improvement, Part I:  Created the structures and cvg 
	      routines necessay to read and write the new element GFA.  JW, (ES),
	      1/27/04.

2	b-13. Changes / additions to CGR library for polygon (time) interpolation.
	      Some necessary routines were extracted from cgrpolysmear.c and
	      placed in the function cgrpolyp.c which is private to the CGR
	      library.  DP, (SJ), 1/29/04.

2	b-14. Airmet/Sigmet improvement, Part II:  Display the new element GFA in
	      NMAP2 & GPMAP.  Right now, the user can create GFA via testcvg, 
	      check the element's content via dumpvgf, then display the element 
	      in NMAP2 and GPMAP. The display settings can be modified through 
	      setting.tbl & uattibd.tbl.  JW, (ES), 1/19/04.

2	b-15. Addressed all problems reported in Problem Report Number 741. 
	      Valgrind now reports no errors or memory leaks using tested data 
	      as well as another test case.  DP, (SJ), 2/5/04.

2	b-16. Airmet/Sigmet improvement, Part III:  Added text plot location into
	      the GfaInfo structure to display the GFA attribute in a text box. 
	      The GFA element has the look of CCF element.  However, GFA element 
	      is designed as a single element while CCF is actually a group of 
	      one LINE and one TEXT element.  JW, (ES), 2/11/04.

2	b-17. A general polygon clipper (gpc) library.  DP, (SJ), 2/18/04.

2	b-18. Airmet/Sigmet improvement, Part IV:  Completed the new GFA (AIRMET)
	      implementation in product generation.  Now, the user can create, 
	      edit AIRMET in PGEN, move its attribute box around, and 
	      move/copy/extrap/smear/delete/modify AIRMET.  JW, (ES), 2/25/04.

2	b-19. Some fixes to the GPC library test program addressing the problems
	      and concerns from test report 745.  Items P1, P2, P5 and O2 have 
	      been fixed.  DP, (  ), 2/26/04.

2	b-20. Added a mechanism  to save the From line from an airmet to a file.
	      JW, (ES), 3/3/04.

2	b-21. Added the ability to draw the degree sign in text strings for both
	      software and hardware fonts.  BY, (AH), 3/5/04.

2	b-22. Extended the airmet attribute window and GFA structure to create 
	      non-convective sigmets.  Also added a new area type "Sustained Wind"
	      to airmet.  Fixed the problems reported in T749 by (1) blocking the
	      GROUP action on GFA_ELM, (2) applying "Partial Deletion" and 
	      "Delete Point" actions only on GFA elements which have more than 3 
	      points, (3) correcting the spelling of turbul"a"nce.  Fixed the 
	      problem T750 - a long input string in AIRMET top and bottom text 
	      boxes may crash NMAP2.  Now they are limited to accept only a 
	      maximum of 6 digits.  JW, (ES), 3/8/04.

2	b-23. Release notes for the new airmet/sigmet element.  ES, (SJ),
	      3/9/04.

2	b-24. Added a local variable(ilens) in dtext.f and dtextc.f instead using
	      the input parameter(lens), which in some cases is constant.  BY, 
	      (AH), 3/9/04.

2	b-25. Minor changes in ncon_sigmets.tbl to its title and spelling.  JW,
	      (ES), 3/11/04.

2	b-26. Minor logic bug fix to GPC test program when reading in vertex list.
	      DP, (SJ), 3/11/04.

2	b-27. Modified dtext.f and dtextc.f in order to handle degree sign in 
	      HPUX.  BY, (AH), 3/11/04.

2	b-28. Fixed T755:P1 the“area type,“station, and forecast hour reset when 
	      selecting a previously saved GFA element and then editting and 
	      applying new attributes; the file name for saving from-line text 
	      may also be wrong.  T755:O1 has been fixed in last delivery 5b-25.
	      JW, (ES), 3/11/04.

2	b-29. Modified dtext.f, dtextc.f, and xstext.c in order to handle degree 
	      sign in HPUX.  BY, (SJ), 3/11/04.

3	b-30. Re-engineer the union and smear functions (CGR_POLYUNION, 
	      CGR_POLYSMEAR) to use the new GPC library calls.  DP, (SJ), 3/26/04.

3	b-31. The changes to implement the gfa/airmet and gfa/ncon-sigmet ended
	      up breaking the CCFP.  We were getting two CCFPs created every time
	      the user placed a new CCFP.  This release undoes that error.  ES,
	      (SJ), 4/3/04.

3	b-32. Bug fix - Examined all polygons returned from the GPC library and
	      eliminated any 'holes' from being returned.  Returned non-hole
	      polygon with the largest areal extent.  Fine-tuned the G_REALLOC
	      and G_FREE macros in gemprm.h.  DP, (DP), 4/5/04.

3	b-33. (1) Added a time interpolation to create new elements from existing
	      elements in pgen.  Any pair of closed elements (lines, SIGMETs,
	      GFAs) may be interpolated.  The interpolation window allows user to
	      provide starting time, ending time and interval.  If the
	      interpolated elements have an embeded discrete time, the starting
	      and ending will be prefilled upon element selection.  (2) Added an
	      option "Other" as the last menu item in the GFA forecast hour menu
	      allowing user to enter a forecast hour not available in the menu.
	      (3) Limited the SMEAR function to work only on the same VG objects
	      (same class, same VG type, same subtype).  Originally, GFA elements
	      with different subtypes may be smeared together.  JW, (ES), 4/7/04.

3	b-34. G_FREE macro fix.  G_FREE macro now has two inputs.  DP, (SJ),
	      4/7/04.
	      
3	b-35. Improved the SMEAR actions on gfa/airmet and gfa/sigmet elements.
	      Originally, when smearing two gfa/airmets or gfa/sigmets with
	      forecast times, the resulting smear figure has the same forecast
	      time as the forecast time of the first selected element.  Now, it
	      has a forecast time that spans the range from start to end time.
	      Strengthened the input check on the forecast hour of gfa elements.
	      It is limited to a format of "xxx-xxx", where x is a digit and the
	      consecutive number of x before/after the dash could be 1 to 3.
	      The dash is optional and only one dash is acceptable as the 2nd,
	      3rd, or 4th character.  JW, (ES), 4/15/04.

3	b-36. Updated the nmap2.hlp file to provide instructions for using the
	      "--" on the command line.  Added release notes for time
	      interpolation.  ES, (SJ), 4/19/04.

3	b-37. Fixed PR: 760:P1 -- a problem in smear that permitted elements of
	      differing types to be smeared together.  ES, (SJ), 4/23/04.

3	b-38. Fixed PR: 759:P1 -- a problem in smear with GFA based elements. 
	      The text displayed with these elements ended up in the same position
	      as the text of the first selected element, which is confusing.  This
	      change places the text for the smear element in the middle of the
	      element.  ES, (SJ), 4/26/04.

3	b-39. Fixed PR: 763:P1 -- a problem in smear with closed lines.  If the
	      lines have a label, the smear line was ending up grouped with the
	      first selected line and its label.  ES, (SJ), 5/3/04.

3	b-40. Created a new library for the creation of the GAMET text product, 
	      for the AWC Graphical Forecast for Aviation project.  LE, (SJ), 
	      6/1/04.

3	b-41. This release contains the release notes for the NWX command line 
	      fix.  ES, (SJ), 6/3/04.

3	b-42. This release contains the release notes for the GFA element.
	      ES, (SJ), 6/4/04.

3	b-43. Added a GFA element to PGEN.  The new GFA element can be created 
	      via testcvg or NMAP.  The new window components needed for the 
	      GFA were also added and selectively managed in the GFA window.  
	      JW, (ES), 6/4/04.

4	b-44. This release fixes P1 and P2 in bug report 778.  ES, (DP), 7/19/04.

4	b-45. Added a new control tool Filter in PGEN to control the display of 
	      VG elements.  The display filter applied to all layers if layering 
	      is active.  When the filter control is active, only those elements 
	      that have no embedded time (all but the GFA based elements) and 
	      those GFA elements that match the selected filter values will be 
	      displayed.  Currently, the filter is only implemented by time, but 
	      later versions may implement filtering by other means as well.  
	      JW, (ES), 7/19/04.

4	b-46. Updated 3 routines with new calling sequences for correct delivery.
	      JW, (ES), 7/20/04.

4	b-47. Fixed the reported problem P2, filter window remained up after 
	      exiting PGEN.  The other reported problem will be combined into 
	      a later project.  JW, (ES), 7/30/04.

4	b-48. Added SMEAR action GUI in pgen to give users more control over the 
	      outcome of a smeared polygon.  Allowed them to choose the color for
	      the smeared element.  Improved the smear results for GFA elements.
	      Smeared GFA element now gets the worst case flight level the 
	      highest top and lowest bottom.  For smeared GFA_GFA element, it 
	      gets worst case severity (description).  Limited smearing between 
	      GFAs to those with the same subtype (airmet, non convective airmet,
	      gfa) and the same area type could be selected/smeared together.  
	      Fixed a bug - the description value were always set to the first 
	      item in the menu when selecting a GFA_GFA element.  It now updates 
	      to the selected GFA_GFA's description value.  JW, (ES), 8/2/04.

4	b-49. This release changes the file name for the AIRMET (class MET) FROM 
	      line to match the AWC's operational naming convention.  It also 
	      updates the assocated help files and includes release notes.  
	      ES, (SJ), 8/5/04.

4	b-50. Modified GPMAP to allow the user to specify a time filter value and
	      selectively display vg elements to the output device.  The time 
	      filter applies to those elments that have an embedded time only. 
	      All others will plot, regardless of filter time.  ML, (ES), 8/5/04.

4	b-51. Changed the filter GUI to display all checkboxes in a single 
	      horizontal row.  Changed the layer GUI to use a single button for 
	      All On/All Off, like the filter GUI.  ES, (SJ), 8/5/04.

4	b-52. Added a hazard number to the GFA elements (same as the sequence 
	      number for Airmets and non-convective sigmets).  Also made several 
	      improvements to the way in which GFAs, AIRMETS, and SIGMETS display
	      based on AWC feedback.  The top and bottom field length is limited 
	      to 3 digits  and will automatically pad to 3 digits if the input is
	      less than 100.  The text will use the same color as the GFA's. If 
	      the top/bottom level is >= 180,“FL” will be prepended to it.  Also,
	      the sequence/hazard number is displayed in the text alongside with 
	      the subtype.  JW, (ES), 8/6/04.

4	b-53. This fixes problem 2 from delivery 5b-48.  The state information 
	      was not completely reset upon exit from the GFA window.  Note that 
	      problem 1 has been defered until 5.8.1.  ES, (SJ), 8/12/04.

4	b-54. This release adds interpolation enhancements including: selection 
	      by area type (i.e. turb, icing, etc., not just GFA, AIRMET, and 
	      non-convective SIGMET), linear interpolation of flight levels, and 
	      use of worst-case description values for GFAs.  ES, (SJ), 8/16/04.

4	b-55. This release adds release notes a new help file for the time 
	      filter in PGEN.  ES, (SJ), 8/18/04.

4	b-56. Fixed 5b-51 P1 and P2.  The layer conrol should now correctly start
	      in “All Off” mode at all times, regardless of whether layring 
	      started from the GUI or an LPF file.  Unrelated to this problem I 
	      also fixed the creation of the horizonal scroll in the Jet.  There 
	      should no longer be any warning message at the command line when 
	      NMAP2 starts.  ES, (SJ), 8/18/04.

4	b-57. Added linkages between the GFA GUI and the layer, filter control 
	      windows, as well as loop changes.  Now, in certain instances, the 
	      GFA window could automatically restart after the user chnages 
	      layers, filter values, or data loops.  This applied to the AIRMET 
	      and the non-convetive SIGMET as well.  This delivery also fixed the
	      problems reported in Task 8.2.1 (delivery # 5b-32): P-1 and S-1.  
	      JW, (ES), 8/19/04.

4	b-58. The AIRMET decoder, DCAIRM, has been modified to add an Issue Time 
	      to the decoded AIRMET.  The Start Time has been changed from the 
	      Issue Time to the actual beginning valid time, the End Time has 
	      been changed to the actual ending valid time.  NMAP2 and GPMAP have
	      been modified to allow plotting AIRMETs in the new as well as in 
	      old format, and to allow the user to control whether to use the 
	      Issue Time or the Start Time to plot AIRMETs.  MG, (SJ), 8/20/04.

4	b-59. This release allows the use of SFC as a bottom flight level in
	      the GFA elements (GFA, AIRMET, non-convective SIGMET).  ES, 
	      (SJ), 8/26/04.

4	b-60. Added release notes and a new help file for the Smear action.
	      ES, (SJ), 8/30/04.

4	b-61. Added release notes for AIRMET valid time decoding.  FY, (SJ), 
	      8/30/04.

4	b-62. Corrected the filter help file for “All On”, “All Off” description.
	      ES, (SJ), 9/2/04.

4	b-63. This release fixes P1 and P2 from the previous delivery and also 
	      fixes compiler warnings in several files.  ES, (SJ), 9/2/04.

4	b-64. This contains the release notes for all the remaining GFA project 
	      items.  ES, (SJ), 9/3/04.

4	b-65. Fixed the reported NMAP crash when switching layer in the middle of
	      drawing a GFA element.  Now, switching layer, loop, filter, or 
	      action after drawing a GFA polygon but before placing the attribute
	      text box will result in an automatic completion of the drawing.  
	      The box will be placed in the ceter of the GFA polygon and the 
	      user can then continue to draw more GFAs.  JW, (ES), 9/3/04.

1	c. T092:  The TPC reported a problem when loading and redrawing their
	   VG files in PGEN. The problem was traced to a bad call that used the
	   wrong coordinate system for the points being used for text with offset
	   values.  SJ, (DP), 11/18/03.

2	c-1. new utility program JOINVGF.  MG, (DP), 3/4/04.

3	c-2. CLIPVGF adds a point to a linear object at the clipping boundary.  
	     It creates an artificial kinks when JOINVGF tries to reconnect the 
	     linear object.  This delivery addresses the problem by removing the 
	     CLIPVGF-added point from the reconnected linear object.  MG, (DP), 
	     3/25/04.

3	c-3  Bug fix.  When determining whether to join two fronts, the entire
	     front code was checked rather than just the 100s digit.  DP, (SJ), 
	     4/14/04.


06.	GPLT Changes


07.	Device Drivers			

1	a. T240:  Set default values for icing and turbulence in the Mid-level
	   cloud text box (_mcldIcngSym = 5 and _mcldTurbSym = 4).  MG, (DK),
	   10/22/03.

1	b. T278:  Fixed the zoom problem in nmap2.  ES, (SJ), 11/12/03.

1	c. T297:  Fixed reading freed memory warning found by purify.  This
	   corrects HPC's observed bug #1.  TP, (SJ), 11/14/03.

1	d. T281:  Enhanced current frame loop stop.  If stopped at last frame,
	   begin loop with first frame.  TP, (SJ), 11/24/03.

1	d-1. Fixed PR #711:P1 and P2.  Backward looping still had an annoying
	     delay at end of loop.  TP, (SJ), 12/1/03.

2	d-2. Fixed PR #733:P5 where grid or fcst data did not rock.  ES, (SJ),
	     12/22/03.

2	e. T302:  The OPC reported that circles that were written to a VG file
	   by the device driver could not be edited. These circles had an
	   invalid number of points stored in the element structure.  Fixed by
	   setting the number of points written to the VG file for circles to a 
	   constant value of 2.  SJ, (AH), 1/2/04.

2	f. T303:  Modified the GIF driver to draw the various fill patterns.
	   SD, (AH), 1/5/04.

4	f-1. Fixed bug in the GIF driver that the AWC discovered.  The driver 
	     would not produce an output file when only an image was being 
	     displayed.  FY, (SJ), 8/16/04.

3	g. T154:  Corrected a bug that occurred in NMAP2 on > 8-bit displays.
	   When image data was reloaded as a result of an enhancement or a fade
	   selection, the bad frame information was lost, and bad frames were
	   redisplayed. To correct this, the bad frame information was saved
	   prior to the reload, and then restored after the reload.
	   HZ, (ES), 4/8/04.

3	g-1. Corrected the LUT problems that occur with two SAT or RAD sources
	     with different LUTs on > 8 bit displays.  ES, (SJ), 5/11/04.

3	h. T308:  Inserted similar solution used by the xw driver to properly
	   handle (GVARRAW) 10 bit (2-byte) visible imagery, which was submitted
	   by Steve Chiswell (Unidata), into the ps, gif and tiff drivers.  AH,
	   (DP), 5/4/04.

4	i. T069:  Fixed UMR by calling xscint in xinita.c.  This change also 
	   fixed the unknown “problem” where the colormap was initialized twice!
	   Xscint is where the actual initialization of the colormap takes place 
	   using a specified color table,  Also, did some more general clean up.
	   TP, (ES), 7/20/04.

08.	General GEMPAK Program Changes 		

1	a. T265:  Bug fix per CPC request - seg fault when invoking KEYCOL
	   option in graph-to-grid.  DP, (SJ), 10/22/03.

1	a-1. Added ice edge boundary file processing to shpcv.  TP, (SJ), 
	     11/26/03.

1	a-2. Bug fix for G2G bounds processing.  All bounded areas should be
	     processed correctly whether user asks for 'true' (bounded areas
	     set to missing) or 'false' (unbounded areas set to missing).
	     DP, (SJ), 12/2/03.

1	a-3. Added createbinfo to $GEMEXE.  TP, (SS), 12/9/03.

2	a-4. Bug fix for when a BOUNDS file specification contains lines with
	     greater than 500 (G2G MAXPPL=500) points. These bounds polygons now 
	     get broken up into 500 point sections to facilitate the bounds 
	     shadowing.  DP, (SJ), 2/18/04.

2	a-5. Bug fix check the total number of contour lines when processing 
	     bounds.  DP, (SJ), 3/3/04.

3	a-6. Re-coding of gline and gfill.  Eliminate improper handling of lines 
	     and polygons which circle the globe in cylindrical coordinates. 
	     DP, (SJ), 3/26/04.

3	a-7. Add the post-processing capability to covert isobar/high/low labels 
	     from 4 digit millibars to the accepted convention of 2-digit 
	     millibars defined as (millibars%100).  JW, (SJ), 5/19/04.

4	a-8. Add three new parameters to graph-to-grid function in GEMPAK and 
	     Nmap2.  TL, (DP), 8/10/04.

4	a-9. Added wind barb and arrow vector information to the contour file of 
	     G2G in PGEN.  The information includes vector type, color, lat/lon 
	     and wind direction and speed.  TL, (DP), 8/10/04.

4	a-10. Release notes.  DP, (TP), 9/3/04.

1	b. T293:  Removed all the references to the obsolete GEMPAK variable
	   ATCO from code, tables and ancillary files.  MG, (DK), 10/24/03.

1	c. T291:  Added a color bar for satellite images, and allowed user to 
	   control the attributes for the image color bar.  ML, (SJ), 11/17/03.

1	c-1. Plot the color bar values in temperature only for imtype of 8 and
	     128.  ML, (SJ), 11/24/03.

1	c-2. Changed the default for IMCBAR to blank.  SJ, (SJ), 12/12/03.
	
4	d. T322:  Added scale legend to all GEMPAK programs that display a map.

	     9/8/04.

4	e. Increased LLMXTG for AIX from 275,000 to 750,000 to be consistent 
	   with all other platforms.  TP, (SJ), 8/31/04.


09.    NMAP

1	a. T267:  Added time range and interval to all data types.  TL, (SJ),
	   10/10/03.

1	a-1. Added the ref. time string input box.  Changed the input for the 
	     range and interval values from a box that allows the user to input 
	     minutes to a set of boxes that user can input days, hours, and 
	     minutes.  HZ, (SJ), 11/21/03.

1	a-2. Fixed 705.O1, where erroneous characters appear on range/intv window
	     ref. time input box, as soon as "Apply" button is pressed in the 
	     presence of keyboard input.  HZ, (DP), 12/3/03.

1	a-3. Fixed default button bug (#696:P2) in range/interval when range = -1.
	     Enhanced time line display for image data when time interval is less
	     than an hour, e.g., radar data.  TL, (SJ), 12/5/03.

1	a-4. Disabled reference time button for forecast data.  TL, (SJ), 12/8/03.

1	a-5. Fixed a bug that interval value is not properly read from SPF file
	     into IMAGE type dominant source.  Fixed a bug that auto-update is 
	     not stopped when user defined ref. time is used.  HZ, (SJ), 12/10/03.

1	a-6. Removed Range/Int button on data window.  TL, (SJ), 12/10/03.

2	a-7. Added time range and intervals to all data types.  Added new
	     algorithm to auto-update when range and intervals are specified.
	     TL, (SJ), 2/17/04.

2	a-8. Fixed a problem in range/intervals GUI.  The auto update button in 
	     the Data Selection Window is in sync with the reference time 
	     selection.  TL, (SJ), 3/11/04.

3	a-9. Event clock for WES/DRT support:  changed the calling sequence of 
	     css_gtim and css_date to use a pointer for itype; removed function 
	     cfdate, SS_GTIM, and SS_LTIM from $GEMPAK/source/gemlibs/ss.  BY,
	     (SJ), 3/25/04.

3	a-10 Modified ermmsg.f to fix a bug when concatenating the time string 
	     with the error message.  BY, (SJ), 4/7/04.

3	a-11 Event clock for WES/DRT:  added the event clock functionality to
	     the CSS library.  BY, (SJ), 4/8/04.

3	a-12 Time line enhancement when updating data sources:  Do not update
	     time line when changing the bottom layer of the data source.  For
	     grid data, the change of the bottom two layers will not update time
	     line.  Removed "Set Time" radio buttons and replaced with "Current
	     Time" push button.  TL, (SJ), 4/19/04.

3	a-13 Changed the event and system time in cssevt.c to time_t type
	     variables.  Added a private routine in cssevt.c to convert time from
	     GEMPAK format to time_t.  BY, (SJ), 5/4/04.

3	a-14 Added a delta reference time (DRT) to SPF for forecast data,
	     MOS, SNF and model grids.  When a user loads a SPF, DRT will be used
	     to determine the forecast start  time so same forecast period can be
	     displayed all the time regardless of forecast cycles.  TL, (SJ),
	     5/11/04.

3	a-15. Added another feature to time line.  The selected frames remains 
	      unchanged when updating the restore files.  Previously the selected
	      frames will always start with the end time.  TL, (SJ), 5/17/04.

3	a-16. Added a new function css_evtadvtime into the css library. This 
	      function returns the event time in seconds since midnight 1/1/1970.
	      This function is called by css_date if the '_event_clock_on' flag 
	      value is true.  Modified css_evtc2t to work on all platforms.  
	      BY, (SJ), 5/24/04.

3	a-17. Modified link scripts.  TP, (SJ), 5/28/04.

3	a-18. Added the calendar edit window back to Nmap2 under range/interval 
	      window.  Users now can specify reference time by typing the time 
	      or using the calendar edit window.  TL, (SJ), 6/1/04.

3	a-19. Added navigation call in range/interval call back. Handled error 
	      code for look up table (LUT) setup so that when loading old image 
	      data, the LUT will be correctly set.  TL, (SJ), 6/3/04.

3	a-20. Release Notes for the timeline changes.  SJ, (SS), 6/4/04.

3	a-21. Synchronized reference time and calendar GUI when loading SPF for 
	      the first time.  Re-initialized delta reference time (RT) when 
	      loading different SPF's.  TL, (SJ), 6/7/04.

3	a-22. In response to test report #774 that time line disappears when 
	      clicking "cancel" on the main window for loaded data.  TL, (SJ), 
	      6/8/04.

4	a-23. Current data matching scheme is hard coded to four (4).  This 
	      delivery allows users to change the data matching scheme through 
	      the preference table.  If no matching option is assigned, the 
	      scheme is set to four (4).  TL, (AH), 7/19/04.

1	b. T246:  Corrected the AIRMET color-coded turbulence display problem 
	   found by the AWC.  Also corrected the upper and lower flight level 
	   filtering if the upper and lower flight levels are set to the same 
	   values.  AH, (SJ), 10/29/03.

1	b-1. Fixed the upper and lower flight level filtering if the upper and 
	     lower flight levels are set to the same values. If they are the same,
	     no AIRMETS should be plotted.  AH, (SJ), 11/14/03.

1	c. T296:  Fixed OPC bug #21 where using "Turn Source Off" feature 
	   combined with image data did not reset navigation properly.  TP, 
	   (SJ), 11/12/03.

2	d. T224:  Fixed 625.P2, where UAIR data will not load if both the 
	   "UAIR Parm Edit" window and "Data Selection" window are both opened 
	   and a level is "keyed in" (as opposed to using the slider bar or arrow
	   buttons), and then the "Load" button is clicked in the "Data Selection"
	   window first.  HZ, (SJ), 12/22/03.

2	e. T304:  Enhanced seek to allow writing 2 points to the Cursor Point
	   File for use in cross_sections.  TP, (SJ), 1/12/04.

4	e-1. Created a new routine, gd_cpf, to process a file name as a value for
	     parameters GPOINT or CXSTNS.  Then modified gdcross.f, gdprof.f, 
	     gdthgt.f, and gdtser.f to call gd_cpf.  TP, (SJ), 7/7/04.

4	e-2. Modified seekw_saveCPF to properly check for valid latitude/longitude
	     points.  TP, (SJ), 7/7/04.

2	f. T119:  Added command line options and parsing to nmap2 to support
	   automatically reading in an SPF file and loading the data without
	   any user interaction.  ML, (SJ), 1/12/04.

2	f-1. Fixed 736:P1, a lut problem for 16- and 24-bit displays, where
	   luts were included in an SPF file.  ES, (SJ), 1/12/04.

2	f-2. Added release notes for the command line options and fixed nmap2's 
	     inability to find the nmap2.hlp file.  ES, (DP), 2/26/04.

3	f-3. Corrected an SPF bug where an upper air forecast data type stored 
	     in an SPF would cause other data types to load improperly.  AH, 
	     (SJ), 5/12/04.

3	f-4. Added an XtRealize to the toplevel widget for NWX.  The toplevel was
	     getting the correct command line inputs but it wasn't realized, so 
	     the command line directives were never acted upon. ES, (SJ), 5/17/04.

4	f-5. The Text Alignment attribute in the setting.tbl and uattribd.tbl 
	     does not have a check on the range of values entered by the user. 
	     If the value is out of range (for example 3), the program does not 
	     crash, but there is strange behavior in the display.  Add a check to
	     where the tables are read to make sure that the value for ALIGN is 
	     -1, 0, 1. If the value is out of range, set it to 0.  HZ, (SJ), 
	     7/7/04.

4	f-6. Re-design NWX to allow the application be iconified through Map 
	     window.  Restore Close window button for Text Report window but 
	     disable the function of it.  HZ, (SJ), 7/12/04.

4	f-7. The Text Alignment attribute in the setting.tbl and uattribd.tbl 
	     does not have a check on the range of values entered by the user. 
	     If the value is out of range (for example 3), the program does not 
	     crash, but there is strange behavior in the display.  Add a check to
	     where the tables are read to make sure that the value for ALIGN is 
	     -1, 0, 1.  If the value is out of range, set it to 0.  HZ, (SJ),
	     7/12/04.

4	f-8. Fixed the location of Map window in NWX.  HZ, (DP), 7/14/04.

4	f-9. Increased MAX_REPORTS in gui.h from 300 to 1000.  TP, (SJ), 7/28/04.


2	g. T205:  Create AODT and AODT History File Management windows (STEP 1).
	   HZ, (DP), 1/21/04.

2	g-1. First delivery of the re-engineered AODT library.  TO, DP, (SJ),
	     2/19/04.

2	g-2. Added Delete Selected ... button on AODT window.  HZ, (DP),
	     3/4/04.

3	g-3. Completely replaced the current v63 directory with entirely new
	     contents.  (Library as delivered from UW as well as compile script
	     for the library.)  DP, (SJ), 4/7/04.

3	g-4. Made AODT window functional by calling subroutines in AODT library.
	     HZ, (SJ), 5/26/04.

3	g-5. Added -I$GEMPAK/source/aodtlib to $ANSI_CFLAGS and $FFLAGS.
	     TP, (SJ), 5/28/04.

3	g-6. Created a standalone program that uses AODT libraries either to 
	     process an image file in order to calculate the tropical cyclone 
	     intensity, or to process the history file, listing or deleting 
	     the records.  Added a link and a help file for the program.  
	     MG, (DP), 5/28/04.

3	g-7. Fixed an AODT segmentation fault bug by modifying odtfreememory.c 
	     file.  HZ, (DP), 6/1/04.

3	g-8. Allow the NMAP AODT function to work properly on zoomed/roamed 
	     imagery.  Test program evaluation forced development of two new IM 
	     functions.  Note that the new function IM_ICMN could replace HSICMN 
	     at the device level.  DP, (SJ), 6/4/04.

3	g-9. Added printing functionality into AODT window.  HZ, (DP), 6/4/04.

3	g-10. Addressed the problem described in the test report by making the 
	      command line handling inside the AODT more robust.  Also, changed 
	      the way the default output file is being handled.  Made changes to 
	      the help file to reflect the aforementioned improvements.  MG, 
	      (DP), 6/7/04.

3	g-11. Created a standalone program that tests AODT library functions.  
	      Added a link file for the program.  MG, (DP), 6/8/04.

3	g-12. bug fix for cloud height--calling sequence fix to GSATPX.  DP,
	      (TP), 6/9/04.

3	g-13. These changes will more accurately compute the image pixel (lat,lon)
	      locations for the AODT algorithm.  These locations, however, will 
	      not be perfectly identical from run-to-run of the nmap2 AODT 
	      algorithm if the zoomed area was changed.  Therefore, if the scene 
	      type is defined to be 'computed', AODT results may not be identical.
	      DP, (ES), 6/15/04.

3	g-14. Change the display format for history recores on AODT HIST window.
	      HZ, (DP), 6/23/04.

4	g-15. Reset _domStrc.current, _landStrc.current, _searStrc.current, 
	      _typeStrc.current values each time when AODT window pops up.  
	      HZ, (DP), 7/7/04.

3	h. T313:  Modified dttmw_yearCb to fix bug where in set time one could 
	   not go forward for years <1980 and could not go backward for years 
	   >2100.  TP, (SJ), 3/24/04.

3	i. T310:  Doubled the number of data loops in NMAP2 for a total of 16.
	   Made no change to the number of available data frames, however.  HZ,
	   (ES), 3/31/04.

3	i-1. Fixed a fatal bug in dev version.  Opening the map window crashes
	     nmap2.  ES, (SJ), 5/11/04.

3	i-2. Increased the pixmap number from 128 to 136.  BY, (ES), 5/27/04.

	      for lat/lon display in VAA text product.  HZ, (DP), 6/14/04.

4	a-19. Currently, the VAA ash cloud GUI has a pull-down menu under the 
	      'other' selection; this menu contains 3 choices:  'Not See', 
	      'Not Avbl' and 'End VAA'.  The latter two choices must be removed 
	      from the selection menu, as well as any resultant code execution 
	      based on those choices.  Check and ensure that the formatted 
	      location of the volcano contains a proceeding zero (or zeros) when

	   (SJ), 10/23/03.

2	b-1. Modified pgolk_getfname so that the full group type name is used
	     when users save the outlook text product file.  Added a new table
	     otlfilnam.tbl.  BY, (AH), 1/21/04.
	     
2	b-2. Modified a subroutine, pgolk_getGroup, in nmap_pgolk.c in order to 
	     use the group type name of the current layer when users save the 
	     outlook text product file.  BY, (AH), 1/27/04.

1	c. T195:  Fixed a wind gust rounding bug in SEL (and other watch prods)
	   found by the SPC.  AH, (SJ), 10/24/03.

1	c-1. Added release note information about new group type, TSTMOLK.
	     AH, (SJ), 11/7/03.

1	c-2. Fixed a bug found by the SPC where selecting  'Final Status' in the
	     'WATCH STATUS' popup box and then 'FORMAT' would cause NMAP2 to hang
	     or crash on LINUX2.4.  AH, (ES), 11/21/03.

1	c-3. Set the Replacement Watch Number textfield to blank whenever the
	     Watch Coordination window is popped up.  ML, (SJ), 11/24/03.

1	c-4. Modified most of the VF library to use the WBC and UTL libraries.
	     Also added the capability to create TEST watch products. 'TEST' will
	     now appear in most of the watch text products when selected in the
	     WATCH FORMAT popup.  AH, (SJ), 11/24/03.

1	c-5. Added the 'status' variable to calling sequence for wbc_dhdl in
	     TESTWBC.  This fixes a bug found when running testwbc_link.  
	     AH, (SJ), 12/1/03.

1	c-6. Removed the hard coded '...TEST' from the WOU-initial and now in
	     NMAP2 when 'TEST' is selected in the Watch Format window, 'TEST' 
	     will be placed in the product.  Hard coded 'EXPERIMENTAL...' into 
	     the WOU update text message.  These changes were made per SCN 03-66.
	     AH, (SJ), 12/3/03.

1	c-7. Fixed the UGC line lengths if the county line is 62 characters long
	     and marine zones will be appended. Line lengths should be equal to
	     or less than 66 characters.  AH, (DK), 12/3/03.

1	c-8. Fixed the UGC line lengths if a full 7 character marine zone is the
	     last item on a line, the next zone appended would make the line
	     length greater than 66 characters.  AH, (SJ), 12/5/03.

1	c-9. Fixed the UGC and UGZ line lengths if the length is 65 characters
	     and another UG code for the same state is starting the second line.
	     On all platforms except Linux, garbage was leading the second line.
	     AH, (DK), 12/10/03.

2	c-10. Fixed a seg. fault error with WBC_DCTY.  If the last state in the 
	      list only had 1 county, NMAP2 would seg. fault when creating the 
	      WOU-i text product.  Added the option of having a VTEC line in the
	      WOU initial and WOUPDT text products.  Also added the string of 
	      the original states in a watch when creating the final WOUPDT text 
	      product.  Modified GG_WWTP to use WBC_DCTY to format the county 
	      UGC and county name section of the text product.  AH, (SJ), 1/29/04.

2	c-11. Added county clustering to the LIST object attribute window.  
	      Clustering only works for LIST element type 'County'.  Added a new,
	      enhanced watch status message, WSMenh_xxxx_YYMMDD.txt.  This message
	      is created when the regular watch status message is created.  It 
	      contains a formatted list of active counties associated with a 
	      particular watch.  AH, (ES), 2/25/04.

3	c-12. Add Marine Zones to All Watch Products.  RT, (AH), 3/24/04.

3	c-13. Add Marine Zones to All Watch Products:  Created two new station 
	      tables, one bounds file, and four map files by combining both
	      NAWIPS counties and the marine zone shapefile information. RT,
	      (AH), 3/31/04

3	c-14. Fixed the enhanced Watch Status Message so that if a List element
	      has been deleted and then later added back to the county list, the
	      associated state will no longer have two listings in the WSMenh.
	      AH, (SJ), 4/8/04.

3	c-15. VTEC line bug fix from SPC:  Added logic so that if the action code
	      for a product is anything except for 'NEW', the start time string
	      in the VTEC line will appear as '000000T0000Z'. Also fixed the event
	      tracking number, etn, so that if it is less than 4 characters long,
	      the number will be padded out with zeros.  Also added a new tag, 
	      UPDT_WOU_ACT_FNL, for changing the action code for the final WOU.
	      AH, (SJ), 4/9/04.

3	c-16. Fix WBC List element bug report by SPC.  Corrected a problem if an
	      issued watch is reissued, two county List elements appear in the
	      .DEFAULT.vgf and then both are saved into the ww####.vgf file. 
	      Added a check to remove the old List element before saving the new
	      List element to the .DEFAULT.vgf file.  (AH), SJ, 4/13/04.
	     
3	c-17. WOU final with CAN or EXP.  Added the use of the tag
	      UPDT_WOU_FNL_TIM to the WOUPDT program. This tag determines how
	      many minutes before the end of the watch that the action code 'EXP'
	      will be used instead of 'CAN' in the VTEC line of the final WOU.
	      AH, (SJ), 4/13/04.

3	c-18. Added marine zone and Great Lake UCG and zone names to the watch by 
	      county text product suite. The products which are affected are: WCL,
	      WOU initial, WOU update, WOU final, enhanced WSM, and the SEV.  The 
	      PWN, AWN, SAW, SEL and cancel SEL should look the same as they are 
	      currently created.  Modified the decoders, DCWOU and DCWCN to use
	      the combined county/marine zone table, mzcntys.tbl.  Modified the
	      display of WOUs and WCNs in GPMAP to be able to plot markers in the
	      marine zones.  AH, (SJ), 4/15/04.

3	c-19. Added a check for the '$$' at the end of the WFO string when
	      decoding the 'ATTN...WFO...' line in the final WOU text product. 
	      If it is found, it is removed before the string is written to the
	      decoded file.   AH, (SJ), 4/19/04.

3	c-20. Added Marine Zones to All Watch Products:  Modified the sorting 
	      section of pgwsmw_wsmCnty. If Coastal Waters are included in the
	      watch, they did not appear at the end of the enhanced WSM product.
	      Now they should appear at the end of the product.  AH, (SJ),
	      4/20/04.

3	c-21. SPC updates to GEMLIB VF code:  Modified WOU and SEV text products
	      so that the "MIDNIGHT" and "NOON" phrases have been removed and
	      either local 12:00 or 1200 AM/PM will be used in place.  Modified
	      SEL and PWN text products to remove the extra blank lines around
	      the discussion portion of the text product.  GG-AH, (SJ), 4/20/04.

3	c-22. In the Watch County Coordination window, after the watch type,
	      expiration date, forecaster name and replacement watch numbers have
	      been selected, these data are inserted into the 'Watch Format' 
	      window in their appropriate text boxes.  AH, (SJ), 4/21/04.

3	c-23. Release notes for the addition of marine zone information to the
	      WBC text products and changes which were make to WCC.  AH, (SJ),
	      4/26/04.

3	c-24. Initialized the locally stored watch elements for the watch type,
	      forecaster name and replacement watch numbers.  It was found under
	      certain instances in the FORMAT WATCH window the expiration date
	      would appear as '05/02/04' and the time would be '14/00'.  Also 
	      corrected where the watch type would be turned on to 'Thunderstorm'
	      without the user selecting any watch type.  AH, (SJ), 5/4/04.

3	c-25. Added checks for the new and old versions of the VTEC lines. The 
	      new VTEC will have the product code id type (a single character)
	      before the action code.  AH, (SJ), 5/4/04.

3	c-26. Fixed PR 765:P1:  Changed the ugcln flag from 0 to 1 in vfwwcl.f so
	      that the ugc line would appear in the text product.  Fixed PR
	      765:P2:  Corrected a segmentation fault when woupdt tried to sort
	      counties.  Also, fixed a bug when a WFO was canceling out the last
	      of their counties.  AH, (SJ), 5/11/04.
	      
3	c-27. Improved the checking for determining a valid VTEC line in the
	      watch county notification (WCN) text messages.  This checking fixed
	      a bug where the decoder did not exit properly and hung.  AH, (SJ),
	      5/11/04.

3	c-28. Fixed a bug in NMAP2 when canceling watches.  Watch text files with
	      watch numbers >= 1000 were not found.  Therefore, cancellation
	      messages could not be created.   AH, (SJ), 5/11/04.

3	c-29. When creating List elements from the active watch counties, 
	      modified how to determine which List element to delete from the 
	      .DEFAULT.vgf file.  Also added initializing the List element before
	      it is created.  This bug was reported by the SPC 5/12/04.  
	      AH, (SJ), 5/19/04.

3	c-30. Changed the edit capability for the 'Severe Weather Watch' GUI 
	      and 'Watch Status Save' GUI from TRUE to FALSE.  It is no longer 
	      possible to edit these windows.  AH, (SJ), 6/2/04.

3	c-31. Changed MZ_CNTY to WBCMZ_BNDS in locator table.  AH, (SJ),
	      6/4/04.

3	c-32. Fixed P1 on PR 772.  Can now reissue watch box on IRIX6.
	      AH, (SJ), 6/4/04.

3	c-33. Increased the storage array for the number of active warnings from 
	      1000 -> 3000.  Also, created a sliding window stating with the 
	      given date/time and search the files backwards till the end file 
	      time is reached.  This bug was found by the SPC (05/31/04).  
	      AH, (SJ), 6/7/04.

3	c-34. Added the ability for previously issued watches to have their 
	      replacement watch numbers displayed in the "FORMAT WATCH" gui if 
	      they are going to be reissued.  This was done at the request of 
	      the SPC (6/7/04).  AH, (SJ), 6/8/04.

3	c-35. When creating the SEV text product, find and ignore the marine 
	      zones.  The SPC does not want them in the SEV text product at this 
	      time (6/10/04).

3	c-36. Removed the colons from the 'FOLLOWING LOCATIONS' line, time and 
	      end of the line, in the WOU and WOU update text products.  Removed 
	      the colon from the enhanced watch status message at the end of the 
	      'FOR THE FOLLOWING AREAS'.  AH, (SJ), 6/28/04.

4	c-37. Increased the array sizes for cname (32->33), cntyname (32->33), 
	      holw(2000->5000) and ugcstr(500->1500).  When a very large watch, 
	      size of Virgina, was drawn, for the LINUX, the WCC and WOU had 
	      'CITY_OF_' attactched to the city names in the independent city 
	      section for VA and the SEV was incorrect.  On the other platforms 
	      NMAP2 seg faulted.  AH, (SJ), 7/7/04.

4	c-38. To help reduce forecaster errors when issuing watches, adding 
	      checks into the watch format processing will help eleminate the 
	      need to issue corrrections for watches.  There are three chages 
	      that the SPC has requested in the watch formatting process:  1.
	      Check for the current watch number in the list of watch replacement
	      numbers ( if any are listed ).  2. Check if the current watch 
	      number has already been used.  3. Always have the WSM check box for 
	      reference mesoscale discussion toggled off when the GUI pops up.
	      RT, (AH), 7/9/04.

4	c-39. In the enhanced watch status message, above the text SEVERE WEATHER
	      THREAT...”, add a line, “STATUS REPORT FOR W? ####”, where: W? Is 
	      the type of watch(WS or WT severe thunderstorm or tornado) #### is 
	      the watch number, not padded out with leading 0's.  Currently, in 
	      the enhanced WSM, the watch number appears at the top of the 
	      message and the watch type is not specified anywhere in the text.  
	      HZ, (AH), 7/19/04.

4	c-40. Updated combined county/marine maps, bounds and tables with July 27,
	      2004 Offshore Marine Zones update.  Modified county centroid 
	      computation algorithm to make sure the computed centroid is inside 
	      the bound.  RT, (AH), 7/23/04.

4	c-41. Changed to display enhanced WSM message on WSM window.  Added 
	      scroll bars for text widget on WSM window.  HZ, (AH), 7/23/04.

4	c-42. Modify the DCWCN decoder to remove the 'or' check for 'EXP' in 
	      wcvtec.f.  WCN counties listed with this description should not be 
	      immediately canceled.  Modify the DCWOU decoder so that those watch
	      cancellation messages with VTEC and state string information will 
	      be decoded as cancel messages.  AH, (SJ), 8/5/04.

4	c-43. Modified the program rebun.c by extracting the rebundle function 
	      from it and moved the function to the cvg library.  Also, added a 
	      new parameter to the calling sequence of cvg_rebun for the name of 
	      the bounds file to use.  MG, (AH), 8/18/04.

4	c-44. In the enhanced watch status message, checked the tag variable 
	      ADD_WSM_WS_WT to check if the line: “STATUS REPORT FOR W? ####” 
	      should be added in the WSM text message.  TRUE, it should be added 
	      and FALSE, it should not be added.  AH, (SJ), 8/18/04.

4	c-45. Release notes for changes made for the watch by county task.  
	      AH, (SJ), 8/30/04.

4	c-46. Added a commented section to WOUi that if 'TEST...' needs to be at 
	      the beginning of the MND line, the change can easily be done by the
	      SPC.  Added to the WOU update text products, if the watch is a test,
	      'MND...TEST' will appear and the product code will be changed to 
	      'T'.  If it is not a test watch, 'EXPERIMENTAL...' will appear and 
	      be an 'E'.  If necessary, if 'TEST...' needs to be at the beginning
	      of the MND, the SPC can easily make the change.  AH, (SJ), 9/1/04.

4	c-47. Changed the order of the 'STZ000-STZ000...' and VTEC lines.  They 
	      come above the 'NO COUNTIES OR PARISHES...' line.  Changed the MND 
	      line to read 'TEST...MND...TEST' if the watch is a test.  Otherwise
	      it will read 'EXPERIMENTAL...MND'.  These changes were made by the 
	      SPC (09/08/04).  AH, GG, (SJ), 9/8/04.

1	d. T294:  Specify location of a work VG file from preference table for
	   Product Generation.  Increased entry value from 25 to 128 in table.
	   TL, (SJ), 11/12/03.

1	d-1. Recasted the issue of VG work file location.  Defined work file in
	     a new header file in the CVG library.  Implemented a CVG function
	     to retrieve the work file for CRG, Nmap2 and PG functions.  TL,
	     (SJ), 11/17/03.

1	d-2. Enabled the usage of environmental variables in the preference table
	     for work file in Product Generation.  TL, (SJ), 12/5/03.

2	d-3. Fixed the problem for selecting a closed VG element. Originally,
	     when two closed lines were pretty close, clicking around the closing
	     segment of one line may result in selecting another line, not the
	     one which was closest to the click point and was supposed to be
	     selected.  JW, (DP), 1/7/04.
	   
3	d-4. Changed the mechanism that controls the pgen palette configuration
	     so that palette configuration can be controlled by the site.
	     Prepared to move to 4 columns by reordering the pgen palette button
	     files.  Added a means to insert a blank, non-functional button in
	     the pgen palette.  HZ, (ES), 3/31/04.

3	d-5. Extended the existing capability to change the type of a selected
	     line or front to work under multi-select. That is, by clicking on
	     a new type of line/front, the type of the selected line/front is
	     changed.  Allowed this same behavior to operate when in multi-
	     select.  HZ, (ES), 4/8/04.

3	d-6. Release notes for multi-select to change the line/front type.  ES,
	     (SJ), 4/8/04.

3	d-7. Fixed two problems reorted by the SPC:  1)  When an output file is
	     specified in an lpf, it is marked as having changes, so that the
	     next Save/SaveAll operation saves the output file, even if the user
	     has not yet made changes to it.  2)  When a file is appended, there
	     is no file name change made, so a Save will not be treated as a
	     SaveAs.  ES, (SJ), 4/19/04.

3	d-8. Added a keyboard delete to PGEN.  With elements selected using
	     either the select or multi-select functions, typing the Delete key
	     will delete all selected elements.  ES, (SJ), 4/19/04.

3	d-9. Fixed 762:P1--problem with the front strength.  If more than one
	     front was getting changed, the strength of the existing front would
	     be changed.  ES, (SJ), 4/29/04.

3	d-10. Added a new module to PGEN which will comtrol multiple selection.
	      The new module extended the drag and shift-click mechanisms now
	      used by the inc/dec and multi-select function to enable the use of
	      these selection mechanism when creating and editing the list
	      element components.  Also add a new pane to the list attribute
	      window to control multiple component selection with three options--
	      add, delete, and toggle.  JW, (SJ), 5/4/04.

3	d-11. Release notes for 1)  Drag and Shift-Click with List element. 2)  
	      Delete key to delete PGEN elements.  3)  Save/Save As/Save All 
	      changes.  ES, (SJ), 5/12/04.

3	d-12. Fixed bug 781, where multi-select and edit of lines failed.
	      ES, (SJ), 6/10/04.

3	d-13. This fixes bug 787.  When in multi-select mode, the pattern size 
	      was getting lost when editing special lines.  ES, (SJ), 6/17/04.

3	d-14. Fix (mostly) fatal floating point error that results if the 
	      PGEN_ICON_NCOLUMN value is undefined in the prefs.tbl.  ES, 
	      (SJ), 6/23/04.

4	d-15. A minor bug fix in a cvg routine so that the work file in NMAP2 
	      won't have multiple delimeters.  TL, (SJ), 7/7/04.

4	d-16. Created a new routuine, cvg_getoutdir, to read a user defined path 
	      for SIGMET product files.  Modified pgsigw_svfilePbCb to use this 
	      new routine.  TP, (SJ), 7/7/04.

4	d-17. Modified nmap_pglayrw.c to add two new buttons to the layer control
	      window.  BY, (ES), 7/7/04.

4	d-18. Added hotkeys 1 - 0 and shift 1 - shift 0 to switch to layers 1 - 10
	      and 11 - 20 respectively.  Removed the rock hotkey '!'.  BY, (ES), 
	      7/7/04.

4	d-19. This release changes the multi-select mode code to use the generic 
	      areal selection code for element selection.  The multi-select“mode
	      includes MULTI_SELECT, INC/DEC, and GROUP functions.  ES, (SJ), 
	      7/9/04.

4	d-20. Added release notes for task 14.2 and updated the appropriate 
	      $GEMHLP help file.  ES, (DP), 7/23/04.

4	d-21. This is a quick fix to enable the labels for symbols to use the 
	      same method as lines do to set the label attributes based on the 
	      selected label string.  This is not the robust, XML-based solution 
	      that was discussed pre-5.7.4.  Rather it is the late-5.7.4 solution
	      that extends the status quo of a creaky design but gets item 14.3 
	      off the to do list.  ES, (DP), 7/27/04.

4	d-22. Retrieved the default attribute values of jet element from a table 
	      rather than hard code.  ML, (DP), 8/5/04.

4	d-23. Release notes and help file changes for the additional symbol 
	      label attribute support.  ES, (SJ), 8/10/04.

4	d-24. Modified the resource file Nmap and source file nmap_pglayrw.c to 
	      make the layer-navigate hotkeys work on HP.  BY, (ES), 8/18/04.

4	d-25. Add release notes and help file updates for layer control hotkeys.
	      ES, (SJ), 8/20/04.

4	d-26. Added the capability to change the text type for JET barb text via 
	      the tables setting.tbl and uattribd.tbl.  JW, (DP), 9/7/04.

4	d-27. Addressed core dump with environmental variables, as noted in above
	      test report, 10d-16.  The support for ~ is not currently implemented
	      in our software.  A proposal exists to address this in the next 
	      release.  Error handling, with a pop-up display, has also been 
	      added.  TP, (SJ), 9/13/04.

4	d-28. Corrected mapping error between grptyp.tbl values and special text 
	      box values for text labels in PGEN.  ES, (SJ), 9/21/04.

2	e. T139:  Added a new AIRMET special symbol to product generation symbols.
	   It is a 30 knot wind barb with '30' over the barb.  This symbol is
	   used in creating AIRMETs to show sustained 30 knot surface winds.
	   AH, (SJ), 1/5/04.

2	e-1. modified the AIRMET decoder DCAIRM to decode sustained winds data.
	     modified the display routine GG_AIRM to display sustained winds
	     AIRMETS as a bounded area in color 12 using a new "sustained winds" 
	     symbol.  modified table miscset.tbl to include new sustained winds 
	     data type.  updated help files.  updated testgg.  fixed a bug in 
	     GPMAP, occuring when GG_AIRM is called with default settings.  fixed
	     a bug in GPMAP, occuring when GG_CSIG is called with default 
	     settings.  mg, (DK), 1/20/04.

2	e-2. Adjusted plotting location of time label for sustained winds ('SW') 
	     AIRMET so that it no longer overplots the SW symbol.  DK, (SJ), 
	     3/3/04.

3	e-3. Fixed AIRMET flight filter/sustained wind bug.  When the sustained
	     winds were inserted at 'fvalu (5)', They conflicted with the lower
	     light level which was also set to 'fvalu(5)'. Therefore, increased
	     the array positions for lvfil(1) and lvfil(2) from 5 and 6 to 6 and
	     7, respectively.  AH, (SJ), 4/7/04.

24.	Maintenance (T300)

2	a. Fixed a crashing bug, 733:P1, in nmap2 where hitting stop after 
	   starting to load two loops of data.  ES, (SJ), 12/22/03.

2	b. Fixed bug with watch box, maximum states array too small.  TP, (SJ),
	   12/22/03.

2	c. Cleaned up alignment of widgets in CCF window.  ES, (SJ), 12/22/03.

2	d. Fixed Michael's Test Report #91:P1 reported on February 24, 2000
	   -- duplicate function IM_QSIZ in testim.  ML, (SJ), 12/22/03.

2	e. Fixed test report problem #348:P1 -- Zoom/Unzoom and Roam deselect
	   the stations for inc/dec function in pgen.  ML, (SJ), 12/22/03.

2	f. Fixed two display problems in the watch specification GUI. (1) The 
	   list of wfos was displayed improperly for a fairly large watch that 
	   has a long list of wfos.  (2) There are meaningless dashed-squares at 
	   the end of "Orient", "Area", and "Inactive" strings.  JW, (SJ), 
	   12/22/03.

2	g. Fixed 256.P1, where the horizontal arrow icon in Seek Window does 
	   not appear for IRIX6.  HZ, (SJ), 12/22/03.

2	h. Fix, 249:P1&P2, track to avoid a crash when the initial number of 
	   points, plus the number of requested extrapolated points exceeds 
	   MAX_TRACKS.  When this condition is reached, terminate the new track 
	   and display it, rather than crashing.  ES, (SJ), 12/24/03.

2	i. Fixed 282.P7, where after issuing/apply a watch, reselect the watch 
	   then draw a new watch and the color attribute for the new watch was 
	   the same as the previously selected watch.  Also fixed 662:01, where 
	   size and width of watch box attribute could be sset to 0.  HZ, (SJ), 
	   12/24/03.

2	j. Fixed 431:O1 & 465:O3, et al. where the map selection GUI was too
	   large.  Also fixed 481:O1, where the auto update state is always
	   saved as 1 (TRUE) even if the dominant source is not IMG.  JW,
	   (SJ), 12/24/03.

2	j-1. Remove recent change that made auto-update default to off for all 
	     data.  This change restores the default on condition for image data.
	     ES, (SJ), 3/11/04.

2	k. Fixed 525.P1, where the "object" pallete is wiped off when the "zoom"
	   is clicked and remains BLANK before an actual "zoom" is done.  HZ,
	   (SJ), 1/2/04.

2	l. Fixed test report problem #734:O1 -- Zoom/Unzoom made "Deselect" 
	   button inactive in the inc/dec window.  ML, (SJ), 1/2/04.

2	l-1. Fixed test report problem #734:o1 -- Zoom/Unzoom made the 
	     "deselect" inactive in the INC_DEC window.  ML, (TP), 1/7/04.

2	m. Realigned the widgets in the print setup GUI and also set their
	   status properly for the first popup.  JW, (SJ), 1/5/04.

2	n. Fixed problem 437:P1 from 5/4/01, where an undo/redo hotkey press was 
	   not routed through the same code as a button press on the pgen palette,
	   so the results were not the same.  ES, (SJ), 1/5/04.

2	o. Made enhancements to seek.  Not sure if specific TPC problems were 
	   addressed.  TP, (SJ), 1/12/04.

2	p. Fixed 736:P2, a lut problem for 16- and 24-bit displays, where an
	   event from the enhancement window keys a data load even when that is 
	   not the right thing to do.  This change prohibits loads as a result of
	   an enhancement selection when either the data or map windows are up.  
	   ES, (SJ), 1/12/04.

2	q. Fixed an outlook message creation bug when using layering in PGEN.
	   If a "SIGNIFICANT SEVERE" line is in several layers and the lines
	   are not grouped to that group layer, the lines would appear in
	   other layer outlook product text messages.  This bug was found by
	   the SPC.  AH, (SJ), 2/2/04.

2	r. Fixed the lut and fade problems on 16 and 24 bit displays.  ES, (SJ),
	   2/2/04.

2	r-1. Fixed the lut and fade problems associated with auto-update on
	     16 and 24 bit displays.  ES, (SJ), 3/3/04.

2	s. Fixed an outlook message creation bug when using layering in PGEN.
	   If a "SIGNIFICANT SEVERE" line is in several layers and the lines
	   are not grouped to that group layer, the lines would appear in
	   other layer outlook product text messages.  This bug was found by
	   the SPC.  AH, (SJ), 2/11/04.  NAWOPR only!

3	t. Fixed OPC reported bug with partial delete and arrowed lines.  With
	   the two arrowed contour lines, the dialog box that allowed the user to
	   indicate which line(s) were to have arrow heads did not allow all
	   choices to be made on linux.2.4.el.  ES, (SJ), 4/29/04.

3	u. Removed the check on 'ntime > MXLOOP'. The check should have used
	   LLMXGT instead of MXLOOP, but on returning from GD_FTIM, 'ntime' 
	   cannot be larger than LLMXGT, therefore, this check is not necessary.
	   This bug was reported by Steve Chiswell/Unidata.  AH, (SJ), 4/29/04.

3	v. Removed file NxmColorInit.c.  None of its modules are used.  TP, (SJ),
	   6/3/04.

3	w. Increased the size of REPMAX from 100000 to 150000 at the request of 
	   SPC.  TP, (SJ), 6/8/04.

3	x. Initialized nb in hlpbld.  Hlpbld failed on Linux2.4EL due to this 
	   oversight.  TP, (SJ), 6/10/04.

4	z. Added check on output string length for ST_UNPR and ST_UNP1.  Corrects
	   a decoder seg fault problem caused by an excessively long bulletin.  
	   DK, (SJ), 7/7/04.

4	aa. Modified pgsigw_create to replace text widget with label widget for 
	    from line display.  Modified other modules as necessary due to this 
	    change.  TP, (SJ), 7/7/04.

4	bb. Reverse calling order of functions GSICMN and IM_ICMN (calling GSICMN
	    second), thus allowing the PS driver code PSICMN to appropriately 
	    reverse the logical meaning of 'top' and 'bottom'.  DP, (ES), 7/19/04.

4	cc. In GLINE.f, prior to calling DLINE, make sure all missing points are 
	    omitted and the line is broken up correctly.  DP, (ES), 7/19/04.

4	dd. Added an 'if' check if CW is listed in the states string but there 
	    are not any marine zones in the county listing (due to marine zones 
	    being turned off) set the number of counties to the stored total. 
	    This fixes a seg. fault with NMAP2 found by CDB.  AH, (ES), 7/23/04.

4	ee. Fixed a bug found by the SPC. With inclusion of marine zones turned 
	    on, if a watch originally included a marine zone and then was resized
	    and the marine zone counties were deleted from the watch, CW was 
	    included in the watch text products when it should not have been.  If
	    ADD_MARZON in prefs.tbl is set to FALSE, CW and Great Lake information
	    was not being added to the watch text files.  AH, (ES), 7/23/04.

4	ff. Fixed a bug in NWX when displaying the Regional Temperature/
	    Precipitation Table.  Sometimes the incorrect table would be 
	    displayed when trying to display the table for a state having a 5 
	    character identifier (e.g., RTPMO) that matches the first 5 
	    characters of a 6 character WMO station identifier (e.g., RTPMOB).  
	    FY, (SJ), 8/12/04.

4	gg. Fixed a core dump problem with the DCSCD decoder caused by an 
	    undeclared string variable.  SJ, (DK), 8/12/04.

4	hh. Fixed the list crashes with large area selection.  Originally, if 
	    the user tries to create a list by drag-drawing a large box, NMAP2 
	    crashes since the number of list items exceeds the maximum number 
	    of points allowed for a single VG element (MAXPTS).   Now, the 
	    maximum number of items in a single list is limited to MAXPTS.  If 
	    the maximum is reached, a warning message will pop up and the user 
	    cannot add more new items.  However, the user can still delete or 
	    toggle items.  JW, (ES), 8/26/04.

4	ii. Release notes for 'Watch lock/resize marine zone and CW error' and 
	    'NMAP2 seg. faulted with out marine zones on the SEV product'.  
	    AH, (SJ), 8/30/04.

4	jj. Release notes.  DP, (TP), 9/3/04.

4	kk. Release notes.  DP, (TP), 9/3/04.

4	ll. Fixed a bug found by the SPC (08/31/04).  The St. Lawrence River 
	    appeared in the WBC text products as a state id.  This caused the 
	    marine zone section to appear in two places in the WCL and WOU 
	    initial text product as well as created a state listing in the SAW 
	    and SEL.  Also found and corrected an initialization of a character 
	    string for the watch status messages.  If the tag ADD_WSM_WS_WT  is 
	    set to FALSE, on aix5, garbage would appear above the enhanced county
	    listing section.AH, (SJ), 9//3/04.

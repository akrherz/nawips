	    .DEFAULT.vgf.  Saving changes to a named file is accomplished
	    by the "save" button.  Also replaced cvg_save with cvg_cp to
	    improve efficiency of file read and writing.  Done, EW, (SS),
	    6/18/97.

	    Began phasing out cfl_xopn calls and replacing with
	    cvg_open calls.  Added continous file scanning feature
	    to TESTCVG.  Created CVQ library.  The intent of this library
	    is to provide a callabel set of VG file query functions.
	    Updated loadx routines to handle special text.  Done, EW, 
	    (SS), 7/2/97.

*	    (VG file is incompatible with previous version.  Must run new
	     program vgfcvt to convert an old VG file to the new version.)

h	u.  Added GUI in NMAP to draw and manipulate special text types
	    1 and 2.  It contains changes to teh cvg routines and the
	    NMAP vgf routines.  Done, ES, (SS), 7/2/97.

	    generation.  Removed texted offsets when moving or rotating.
	    Done, EW, (SS), 7/14/97.

h	y.  Corrected some bugs in special symbol drawing that were 
	    causing the map to be improperly drawn.  Removed color
	    setting for lines, text and fill for special text.  The
	    text and lines are drawn in a single color, and the fill
	    is done with the background color.  Done, SJ, (SS), 7/15/97.

h	z.  Properly handle old versions of .DEFAULT.vgf file when
	    NMAP product generation is initiated.  Done, EW, (SS),
	    7/15/97.

i	aa. Added remaining 7 special text types to NMAP GUI.  Also
	    corrected error in vg driver routine, VTXSY.C where lat and
	    lon were swappped in a calling sequence.  Done, ES, (SS),
	    7/17/97.

i	bb. Added a dialog box when drawing lines in NMAP that allows
	    for closing and/or filling.  Also improved the drawing
	    mode for lines and fronts so that the drawing for an
	    element remains active after it is drawn.  That is,
	    it is no longer necessary to go back to the paleltte
	    after drawing one item to draw it again.  Done, EW, 
	    (SS), 7/17/97.  

i	cc. Added filled arrowheads and dashed line to NMAP product
	    generation code.  Done, DP, (SS), 7/22/97.

	    Improved technique for obtaining information from the
	    wind editor widget.  Done, DK, (SS), 7/23/97.

*	    (The drawing.tbl file is incompatible with previous 
	     versions of this file).

i	ee. Updated NMAP GUI and cvg functions for changes made to
	    the special text including software text, and adding
	    additional attributes.  Done, ES, (SS), 7/23/97.

i	ff. Corrected problem in moving special text in NMAP.  Done,
	    ES, (SS), 7/23/97.

i	gg. Recoded ITXSY to use the offsets and rotation.  The
	    bounding boxes now match the software text sizes and
	    the points are computed correctly.  Done, SJ, (SS),
	    7/23/97.

i	hh. Activated left and right justification for special text.
	    Also fixed bug for low-level turbulence symbol.  Done, SJ,
	    (SS), 7/23/97.

	    been drawn.  Done, EW, (SS), 7/30/97.

	    significant weather text bulletins from a VG file.  Done,
	    FY, (SS), 7/31/97.

	    to use contour lines instead of frontal lines for turbulence.
	    Done, FY, (SS), 8/5/97.

j	ll. Corrected an indexing problem in cgrpolyint.c. Also, removed
	    nulls from the end of the bulletin text produced by avnbul.
	    Done, FY, (SS), 8/6/97.

	    grP_>colorPalW widgets.  Done, ES, (SS), 8/11/97.

k	oo. Modified avnbul to handle the graphics type "line" for 
	    turbulence that is generated automatically. Also added
	    "-XXX" to the turbulence string when only one level is
	    given. Done, FY, (SJ), 8/14/97.

l	pp. Fixed the call to DTURB in NxmPlaceText to send the correct
	    value of the turbulence symbol when trying to plot a 
	    combination of two symbols. Done, ES, (SJ), 8/14/97.

l	qq. Made VG file selection box more generic for opening and
	    saving VG files. Major cleanup of NxmFileDlg.

	    generation data structures and code.  Created new crg
	    library to handle range calculations.  Removed range
	    data from the Graphics Info Record.  Removed inclusion
	    of xwdrawcmn.h from routines that no longer use the
	    graphics info record.  Remove cvg_loadx and update 
	    cvg_load to have a flag for loading elements that
	    are not editable.  Done, EW, (SS), 9/4/97.

l	tt. Removed CmdInfo record and structure from the GrInfoRec
	    structure in xwdrawcmn.h.  Its functionality is repaced with
	    a new library under cgemlib call cmd.  All affected routines
	    in NMAP and CGEMLIB have been updated to reflect this change.
	    Done, ES, (SS), 9/9/97.

l	uu. Corrected bug in the cmd library that was causing the last
	    class (usually winds) to be unavailable to the user.  Done,
	    ES, (SS), 9/11/97.

l	vv. Changes were made to the vgstruct header file which affect
	    all product generation libraries under cgemlib and NMAP routines.
	    The latlon and Pt data structures were removed.  Coordinate
	    arrays are now referenced as entire arrays of individual 
	    coordinates rather than as arrays of coordinate pairs.  Also
	    the ghost line problem which affected some platforms was fixed.
	    Done, DP, (SS), 9/17/97.

	    cesrstng.c and updated testces.  Also removed cpgrstng
	    which is no longer used.  Done, CL, (SS), 9/29/97.

l	aaa. Modified AVNBUL to be compatible with new version of vgstruct.h.
	     Also modified it to use the new drawing table, newdraw.tbl.
	     (Removed old drawing table from system, drawtbl.tbl).  Done,
	     FY, (SS), 9/30/97.

	( * indicates a change that makes this version of NAWIPS
	    incompatible with the previous version )



001.	ASCII Decoders

l	a. Added a new routine which conducts quality checks on 
	    synoptic pressure data.  Done, TL, (TP), 2/25/99.

m	b. Changed calling sequence of dc_stns and sf_ldta to add
	   priority parameter, ispri.  Done, AH, (TP), 3/17/99.

n	c. Add check for invalid report identifier in marine decoder.
	   Corrected elevations for several stations based upon 
	   information from the EMC.  Done, DKW, (TP), 4/7/99.

o	d. Created subroutine affarp.f to handle reports from
	   UAXX10 EGRR aircraft bulletins.  Done, AH, (TP), 4/14/99.

o	e. Fix to process watch cancellation time correctly,
	   improve positioning of labels, Y2K.  Done, DKW, (TP), 
	   4/23/99.

o	f. Modified watch box decode to allow issue time for a
	   correction to be up to 30 minutes after watch start
	   time, and to remove trailing blanks from time labels.
	   Done, DKW, (TP), 4/27/99.

p	g. Modified watch box decode to allow issue time for a watch
	   to be up to 9 minutes after watch start time.  Done, DKW,
	   (TP), 5/13/99.

p	h. Wrote decoder driver for real-time or batch mode
	   processing for tornado and severe thunderstorm watch box
	   reports (WWUS9 bulletins).  The output from this decoder is 
	   an ASCII file.  Done, DKW, (TP), 5/17/99.

p	i. Created a new decoder that decodes the severe thunderstorm
	   warning, tornado warning, and flash flood warning text
	   reports.  Done, AH, (TP), 5/19/99.

p	j. Modified the warning decoder subroutines such that:
	   1. if an empty filename is returned, the file is not created
	   2. if the warning type, start/stop times, station id, or the
	      correction indicator is missing, nothing from that 
	      bulletin is written to the file.
	   3. corrected an indexing problem with the start time string
	   Done, AH, (TP), 5/20/99.

p	k. Modified the warning decoder subroutines such that: 

	   1. if only eight lines are in the header, the time line is
	      still found and it wtype is used to call the right
	      subroutine.
	   2. if any part of the ending time array is missing, the 
	      entire array is set to missing.
	   Done, AH, (TP), 5/24/99.

q	l. Fixed watch box decoder dcwtch to treat replaced watches
	   as watch cancellations.  Revised watch number decoding 
	   scheme.  Done, DKW, (TP), 5/28/99.

q	m. Modified a calling parameter to ST_ALNM in the flash flood
	   tornado and severe thunderstorm warning subroutines.  Also
	   corrected a logical IF statement.  Done, AH, (TP), 6/3/99.

q	n. Reworked and simplified the warning decoder, DCWARN.  This
	   version gets all of the warning information from the first
	   four lines of the warning's header.  Created a new 
	   subroutine that writes out the ASCII information in one 
	   place.  Done, AH, (TP), 6/8/99.

r	o. Modified the metar decoder to decode off-time reports.  
	   Done, FY, (TP), 6/25/99.

s	p. Modified watch box decoder dcwtch to decode WWUS40 
	   bulletins instead of WWUS9 bulletins.  WWUS40 gives more
	   accurate values for the watch box corner points.  Done,
	   DKW, SJ, (TP), 7/12/99.

s	q. Modified aircraft decoder dcacft to handle more groups of
	   PIREP data (pilot reports).  The sky cover group will now
	   be decoded, as well as more fields in the icing and 
	   turbulence groups.  Done, DKW, (TP), 7/13/99.

t	r. Modified aircraft decoder dcacft to output text (report string)
	   to Gempak file, and to output all base and top heights in feet
	   instead of meters.  Cleaned up code, internal call sequences,
	   and documentation.  Done, DKW, JA, (TP), 7/28/99.

u	s. Replaced RA_RTIM with DC_GTIM in the ngm mos, mrf mos, avn
	   mos, and scd decoders.  Done, FY, (TP), 8/24/99.

u	t. Modified watch box decoder dcwtch to also decode WWUS8
	   (watch status) bulletins.  Cleaned up code.  Done, DKW,
	   (TP), 8/25/99.

u	u. Several changes were made to the marine surface decoder, 
	   DCMSFC, and to the land surface decoder, DCLSFC.  Done, FY, 
	   BH, (TP), 8/27/99.

u	v. Modified aircraft decoder dcacft (at the request of AWC) to
	   improve decoding of haze and haze tops.  Also minor bug fixes
	   and change to interface mnemonics for consistency across
	   decoders.  Modfied watch decoder dcwtch to correctly decode
	   status reports which specify two lines, rather than the usual
	   one.  Minor bug fix to land synoptic decoder dclsfc.  Done,
	   DKW, (TP), 9/3/99.

v	w. Modified aircraft decoder, dcacft, to allow decoding of PIREP
	   temperatures that are reported as a single digit.  Done, JA,
	   (TP), 9/16/99.

w	x. Modified aircraft decoder to explicitly initialize several 
	   interface "counter" variables to zero and to add an array bounds
	   check for decoding of turbulence.  Done, JA, (TP), 10/4/99.

w	y. Modfied watch decoder dcwtch to handle variations in status
	   message format.  Specification of two status lines is now
	   decoded correctly, and status message format changes scheduled
	   to take effect on Oct. 18 should be handled properly.  Done,
	   DKW, (TP), 10/4/99.

w	z. Created a new decoder that decodes forecast/advisory reports
	   for tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes.
	   These reports are the WTNT23, WTNT24 and WTPZ23.  Done,
	   AH, (TP), 10/4/99.

w	aa. Made corrections to the hurricane decoder and display in
	    GPMAP.  Corrected for stationary storms, cleaned up
	    placements of storms in the Atlantic, shifted the labels
	    so that they don't overwrite symbols.  Allow for decoding
	    of WTNT21-25 and WTPZ21-25 reports.  Done, AH, (TP), 10/6/99.

w	bb. The synoptic decoder, dclsfc, and the marine decoder, dcmsfc,
	    are being modified to fix a bug which prevented weather
	    symbols from being plotted when the observation came from an
	    automated station.  Also, ships which report from the Great
	    Lakes will now use the elevation of the lake as the ship's 
	    elevation (instead of 0).  Done, DWK, (TP), 10/7/99.

w	cc. In DCHRCN decoder, check for missing central pressure values
	    and position accuracy distances.  Done, AH, (TP), 10/8/99.

w	dd. Corrected the watch status message format (WWUS8 bulletins) for
	    change scheduled to take effect on Oct. 18.  Done, DKW, (TP), 
	    10/8/99.

w	ee. Created a new decoder, DCISIG, that decodes international
	    SIGMET reports.  Initially, the decoder handles bulletins from
	    KMKC (with bulletin header WS..0. ) and report types of
	    thunderstorm, hurricane and turbulence only.  The output is
	    written to an ASCII file.  Done, DKW, (TP), 10/14/99.

w	ff. Modified DCISIG, which decodes international SIGMET reports,
	    with several minor improvements, bug fixes, and output
	    format changes.  Wrote new routine GG_ISIG to be used to
	    display international SIGMETs in GPMAP using the new
	    GEMPAK variable ISIG.  Done, DKW, (TP), 10/22/99.

w	gg. Moved "field" declaration out of afcmn.cmn.  Done, JA, (TP),
	    11/2/99.

w	hh. Bug fix to watch decoder dcwtch to handle case where status
	    line definition is the last thing in the bulletin.  Done,
	    DKW, (TP), 11/3/99.

w	ii. Modified DCISIG, which decodes international SIGMET reports, to
	    decode reports from KNHC and to decode tropical storms and
	    tropical depressions.  Modified routine GG_ISIG which displays
	    international SIGMETs in GPMAP to include tropical storm and
	    tropical depression symbols.  Fixed bug in symbol position when
	    SIGMET crosses the dateline.  Done, DKW, (TP), 11/5/99.

w	jj. At the request of the AWC, several changes are being made to the
	    display of aircraft obs in NMAP: 1) a simpler standard parameter
	    matrix will be used for the default display; 2) the "heat" parameter 
	    is being removed from the display list, and all acft flight levels
	    will be shown in 100s of feet, instead of meters; 3) XX999 (military
	    aircraft) reports have been removed from the GEMPAK output file
	    (note - we don't see these reports here via FOS, but they get them 
	    on their X.25 line.)  Done, DKW, (TP), 11/8/99.

w	kk. Modified hurricane decoder, DCHCRN, to find the advisory number
	    if the word 'SPECIAL' is in the storm name line.  Done, AH,
	    (TP), 11/15/99.

x	ll. Replaced the error code group argument 'RA' with 'DC' in call to
	    dc_wlog after invoking dc_gtim in the avn mos, ngm mos, mrf mos,
	    and scd decoders.  Done, FY, (TP), 12/1/99.

x	mm. Modified DCISIG, which decodes international SIGMET reports, to
	    decode reports from PHNL and PGUM.  Bug fix for decoding areas
	    on "either side of line", and minor improvements and clean-up
	    of code.  Modified to handle new format for lat/longs (degrees
	    and minutes), which becomes effective 1/3/00.  (Both current
	    (degrees and tenths) and new formats are acceptable.)  Added
	    new routine PR_HGNM to convert nautical miles to meters.
	    Done, DKW, (TP), 12/1/99.

x	nn. Modified decoder dcisig to handle case when there is no keyword
	    to start an area definition.  Done, FY, (TP), 12/7/99.

y	oo. The flash flood guidance decoder has been modified to handle
	    either 4 or 2 digit year coding.  Some RFCs are now using
	    the 4 digit code.  Done, DKW, (SS), 12/27/99.

y	pp. Improved validity checks for international SIGMET decoder
	    (dcisig) lat/long input values.  Done, DKW, (TP), 1/5/00.

y	qq. Changed DC_WLOG to check the error number and return immediately
	    if the value is zero.  Changed DC_INIT to parse command line
	    option "-e PARM=value".  This allows the user to set the value
	    of an environment variable that may be necessary for running a 
	    decoder.  These changes were suggested by Unidata.  Done, SJ,
	    (TP), 1/7/00.

y	rr. A modification was made to the marine decoder, dcmsfc, to
	    check for an invalid report time of 24 hours in a ship
	    report.  This change was made in response to a problem
	    noted by the MPC.  Done, DKW, (SS), 1/19/00.

y	ss. Added the decoding of WSUK31 and WSNT21 international sigmet
	    reports from EGGY to decoder dcisig.  Modified dcisig to handle
	    the new WMO header and identifier KKCI.  Fixed bug in dcisig
	    when keyword is 'OBS/FCST' or 'FCST/OBS'.  Decoded some
	    previously missed flight levels.  Included 'AXIS' as a keyword
	    for either side of line.  Done, FY, (TP), 1/20/00.

y	tt. Modified international SIGMET decoder dcisig to handle error
	    condition when calculating boundary points on either side of a line.
	    Done, DKW, (TP), 1/20/00.

y	uu. Modified aircraft decoder dcacft and character translation routines
	    to save and display aircraft type (ACTP) for PIREPS (pilot reports), 
	    and to use the PIREP reporting station id as the STID.  Done, DKW,
	    (TP), 1/20/00.

z	vv. Corrected how the date/time was being saved in the header
	    portion of an AWIPS file.  Increased the file size for the number
	    of bytes from 20000 to 80000.  Done, AH, (TP), 2/7/00.

z	ww. Modified aircraft decoder dcacft to decode varying formats of
	    turbulence data reported in AIREPs (aircraft reports), in
	    response to AWC request.  Done, DKW, (TP), 2/11/00.

z	xx. Added the decoding of WSJP31 international sigmet reports from
	    RJAA to decoder dcisig.  Done, FY, (TP), 2/15/00.

z	yy. Increased the length of the county character string in the
	    warning decoder, DCWARN.  With these changes, the county listing
	    which continue on to additional lines, will be read as one
	    continuous line.  Done, AH, (TP), 2/25/00.

z	zz. Fix problem report 285:P1.  DCWARN no longer crashes when
	    'BULLETIN' is not found within the file.  If it is not found and
	    it is a new report hour, the output file is not created.  
	    Done, AH, (TP), 2/28/00.

z	aaa. Added the decoding of some open areas for EGGY sigmet reports to
	     decoder dcisig.  Expanded to include EGGY cancel reports. Picked
	     up flight level in long reports.  Done, FY, (TP), 3/10/00.

z	bbb. This change to the metar decoder, dcmetr, allows an AWIPS id (PIL)
	     to follow the WMO header, fixes a bug which caused a segmentation
	     fault on a Solaris machine when attempting to decode pressure 
	     tendency, and decodes mean sea level pressure from the remarks
	     section of Mexican reports.  Done, DKW, (TP), 3/10/00.

z	ccc. Increased the record length storage in the RBK driver.  Adjusted
	     the record read for the AWIPS files that are read in in GPMAP.
	     Added a check if the special character is equal to zero.
	     Done, AH, (TP), 3/13/00.

z	ddd. Added leading zeroes to the decoded flight level when it has less
	     than three digits and truncated the extraneous blanks in decoder
	     dcisig.  Added EGGY cancel reports indicated by only "CNL".
	     Done, FY, (TP), 3/15/00.
	     
z	eee. Bug fix to watch decoder dcwtch to recognize station names
	     containing the characters 'TO'.  Done, DKW, (TP), 3/16/00.


002.	GRIB Decoder



003.	Grid Diagnostics

z	a. Added a GEMPAK program to write gridded data into GRIB files.
	   Done, KB, (TP), 3/13/00.


004.	Parameter Calculations



005.	Image Processing

v	a. Added new routines to get the pixel value on an image file.
	   TL, (TP), 9/22/99.

v	b. Checked image bounds for the pixel retrieval algorithm.  Fixed
	   return code for cloud height search routine.  Done, TL, (TP),
	   9/24/99.


006.	GPLT Changes

p	a. Modified the check for possible directions in the contouring
	   algorithm routine CCBOXT.  If the grid box is entered from the
 	   top or bottom, the line turns left of the direction of motion.
	   If the box is entered from the left or right, the line turns
	   right.  This eliminates a problem where a direction cannot be
	   chosen and the line is redrawn from a different starting point,
	   thus overlapping the center of the contour.  Done, SJ, (TP),
	   5/11/99.

q	b. Y2K fix for MCIDAS code.  Done, DKW, (TP), 5/28/99.

q	c. Fixed drawing lat/lon lines for satellite projection
	   (un-remapped) images.  The lines would plot in the Easterna
	   Hemisphere and stop at 180 degrees.  Fixed drawing lon lines
	   for the MCD (McIDAS RECT) projection.  The lines would not
	   appear for a global topography image used by the AWC.
	   Done, SD, SJ, (TP), 6/7/99.

y	d. Modified the drawing of special line and front patterns.
	   The direction flag now re-orders the array of points.  Also,
	   pattern number 15 has been mofified to draw a center line
	   for the arrow head.  Updated the pattern list for special
	   line type 22 in the table splpat.tlb.  Done, SJ, (SS),
	   12/27/99.

y	e. Modified NAWIPS programs to be able to directly read normal
	   GEMPAK map files while on Little-Endian platforms.  Done,
	   GK, (TP), 12/30/99.

y	f. Corrected a problem where the labels for the latitude lines in
	   the southern hemisphere were being clipped.  Done, TP, (TP),
	   12/30/99.

y	g. Modified and added potental new contour types for GEMPAK.
	   Added type "L" which is the GEMPAK contouring algorithm
	   without sub-boxes.  Eliminated types "I" and "S" which
	   were never implemented.  Done, MLI, (TP), 1/10/00.

z	h. Changed the contour fill and box-fill to treat CONTUR=1 the same
	   as CONTUR=0. This now matches the behavior for the contour lines.
	   Done, SJ, (TP), 2/29/00.


007.	Device Drivers

l	a. Created a form-fitting blank background fill for arrows 
	   and barbs.  Changed all software lines to have rounded
	   ends the same as hardware lines in the XW and PS drivers.
	   Added the TIFF driver to PLOTSYMS.  Done, SJ, (TP), 
	   2/24/99.
	   
m	b. Fixed a bug in the postscript driver to maintain the use
	   of the background color for drawing when the user has 
	   requested the monochrome option.  Fixed cds_wind to change
	   any wind type theat ends in "4" to the new form-fitting 
	   background blank.  Done, SJ, (TP), 3/2/99.

m	c. Added background blank-out to symbol plotting.  Done,
	   DP, (TP), 3/4/99.

m	d. Added plotting markers as hardware symbols in the UTF and 
	   RBK device drivers.  Done, SJ, (TP), 3/19/99.

n	e. Fixed the calculation of the number of bytes in the last
	   block of data for the UTF driver.  Done, SJ, (TP), 3/24/99.

n	f. Added the ability to construct a single UTF string 
	   consisting of all station model data for the Medium Range 
	   Temp/POP products.  Done, SJ, (TP), 3/26/99.

n	g. Allow flipping of streamlines.  Done, SJ, (TP), 4/2/99.

o	h. Added the routing information "ALL" to the PIL header for
	   AFOS graphics products created with the "||c" option for 
	   the DEVICE parameter.  (This was requested by the SPC.)
	   Done, SJ, (TP), 4/16/99.

o	i. Fixed the size of the background arrow head for clearing
	   data behind an arrow.  Done, SJ, (TP), 4/21/99.

	   is readable by NAFOS and GPMAP.  Done, SJ, (TP), 5/28/99.

u	l. Fixed RBK driver to handle the Medium Range products, and fixed
	   other bugs in the header of the file.  Changed the scale factor
	   for the curve smoothing.  Done, SJ, (TP), 8/24/99.

v	m. Changed the PostScript commands to select the paper size to
	   use the Level 3 syntax. Changed the large page size from
	   24x36 to 20x32. Added a new larger page size, 32x42.  Done,
	   SJ, (TP), 9/13/99.

v	n. Added a check for parts of a circle outside of the clip area.
	   If part of the circle is outside, the circle is drawn using
	   the software method. If the circle is completely in the clip
	   area, and the driver has the ability to draw a circle using
	   hardware commands, that option is used.  Done, SJ, (TP),
	   9/23/99.

w	o. New xw driver routines for nmap2 and modifications to ensure
	   existing version unaffected.  Done, ES, (TP), 10/6/99.

w	p. Fixed bugs affecting nmap in XW driver.  After selecting "show" 
	   following  "hide" the current frame number was reported as 1
	   less than it actually is.  Secondly, the rock button often
	   resulted in the loop freezing.  Modified xclear so NMAP2 can
	   call gclear now instead of the work-around routine xmclear.
	   In NMAP2, the load routine has been broken down into a
	   separate loop load routine.  Roam is now working, but only with
	   one (1) loop.  It crashes with more than 1 loop of data loaded.
	   Done, ES, (TP), 10/25/99.

w	q. Made extensive changes to the xwdriver to accomplish seperate roaming
	   in each loop.  Added auto-update to nmap2.  Done, ES, (TP), 11/3/99.

w	r. Modified mtext.c in the nc driver to correct problem with plotting 
	   negative latitudes in NTRANS.  Done, TP, (TP), 11/22/99.

x	s. Fixed the time in the short header for AWIPS Red Book graphics
	   files.  The byte for the hour was incorrectly assigned the value
	   for the month.  Done, SJ, (TP), 12/13/99.

x	t. Modified xwcmn.h for NMAP2.  Fixed image jump problem and 
	   product generation refresh problems on zoom/roamed frames.  Loop
	   selection is now allowed from product generation.  Done, ES, (TP),
	   12/13/99.

x	u. Restore mtext.c back to original.  This undoes delivery 007r
	   dated 11/22/99 of patch w.  Done, TP, (TP), 12/14/99.

y	v. Fixed the cvg_load problem in nmap/nmap2.  Done, ES, (TP), 1/5/00.

y	w. Fixed problem with NMAP2 core dumping when exiting product generation
	   after selecting 'Clear Data'.  Done, SL, (TP), 1/20/00.

y	x. Renamed the command defines in xmloop.c and moved them to xwprm.h.
	   Changed nmap_loopw.c to use these defines rather than hard-coded
	   numbers.  Cleaned up the code in nmap_loopw.o for NMAP2.  Done,
	   SL, (TP), 1/20/00.

z	y. Changed the load sequence for models to load the first frame first.
	   Changed the current pixmap variable to an array so that it would
	   keep track between loops.  Did other cleanup of the xdriver, including
	   moving several calls to copy the current pixmap to the screen to a
	   seperate function (xpxm2win).  Done, SL, (TP), 2/14/00.

z	z. Restored the flip action, for the fronts, to just change the pip
	   direction. For special lines, the flip reverses the order of the
	   vertices.  Done, SJ, (TP), 2/17/00.

z	aa. Added the missing declaration of "text" to vtext.c.  Done, MLI,
	    (TP), 2/18/00.

z	bb. Fixed bug of integer problem in HTXSY.F.  Fixed txtstr length
	    bug in nmap_stnmw.c.  Done, MLI, (TP), 2/18/00.

z	cc. Added the ability to set a base date for a product when the RBK
	    driver is used.  Done, AH, (TP), 3/7/00.

p	qq. Interpretation of the /MAN flag in the GEMPAK variable
	    LEVELS has been changed so that when /MAN is specified,
	    any application will use only mandatory level data with
	    NO interpolation.  (Formerly, interpolation would occur.)
	    Replaced references to PC_DSET with PC_INIT.  Done, DKW,
	    (TP), 5/14/99.

p	rr. Modified GG_WTCH to read the files created by the decoder

	    table.  Changed a parameter in nwx for consistency.  
	    Done, DKW, (TP), 5/28/99.

q	aaa. Implemented changes to DM_RFLT and DM_WFLT suggested by 
	     users in the field.  The users share data files between 
	     Linux and DEC Alpha workstations.  The fix allows data to 
	     be read if written by another workstation type that uses
	     the VAX-like byte order for reals.  Done, SJ, (TP), 
	     6/1/99.

q	bbb. Modified display of watch and warnings to have the option
	     to not label them.  It is now possible to display the watch
	     box information without the box number and the warning
	     information without the county names.  The defaults for
	     the WATCH_WARN in NMAP have been changed so that only the
	     boxes for watches and diamonds for warnings are displayed.
	     No label information is given.  For now, the user cannot
	     change these options.  Done, AH, (SS), 6/4/99. 

q	ccc. Updated N-AWIPS to Patch5.4.3.q.  Done, TP, (TP), 5/28/99.

	     after a VG file is displayed.  This prevents the problem
	     of text attributes from the VG file being used in subsequent
	     GEMPAK programs, like GPTEXT, when they are not explicitly
	     set.  Done, TL, (SS), 7/6/99.

t	kkk. Updated N-AWIPS to Patch5.4.3.t.  Done, TP, (TP), 7/19/99.

t	lll. Made numerous enhancements to gdplot2:  Implemented cycle
	     information to GDPLOT2 so that it works the same way as
	     the rest of the GD programs.  Also, fixed problems so that
	     GDPLOT2 will plot the data correctly for non-standard grid
	     time, e.g., first, f24, fall, first-last-6, when grid file
	     is etaf.  Cleaned up flmfls.f and unified single file
	     retrieval algorithms. Added cycle in the calling sequence.
	     Enabled FL_MFIL to compare files with forecast times.  
	     Increased # of file names to be searched from 200 to 300.
	     Uppercased terminal output for gdplot2.  Done, TL, (TP),
	     7/20/99.

t	mmm. Added the start of the SIGMET class functions.  Currently,
	     it allows initial creation of an international SIGMET. 
	     Only the isolated, line and area can be drawn.  No other
	     functions are available with this initial delivery.
	     Done, SL, (TP), 7/23/99.

t	nnn. Added new routine, clo_from, which returns a sigemt "from"
	     line given a set of lat/lon points. Done, DP, (SS), 
	     7/28/99.

	     spherical trig calculations.  Done, DP, (TP), 8/11/99.

t	sss. Modifications to the sigmet display code. Added VGTYPEs
	     for non-convective sigmets, convective sigmets, convective
	     outlooks and airmets to the setting.tbl.
	     Done, DP, (SJ), 8/13/99.

u       ttt. Updated N-AWIPS to Patch5.4.3.u.  Done, TP, (TP), 8/25/99.

	     heights of specific temperatures from a sounding station 
	     which is closest to a given point.  Done, TL, (TP),
	     8/30/99.

u	vvv. Added watch status lines to GG_WTCH. Changed all routines
	     that reference GG_WTCH to send a color for the status lines.

	     status line color.  Done, SJ, (TP), 8/31/99.

u	www. Changed calling sequence to CGR_SEGINT.c to return the actual
	     intersection point of the two lines defined by the segments, 
	     regardless of whether the segments themselves intersect.  
	     Done, DP, (TP), 8/31/99.

u	xxx. Changes for international sigmets:  1) use actual element 
	     distance when drawing circle around isolated type; also use 
	     distance when plotting implementation of different line types
	     (ESOL, NOF, etc.); 2) make "from" line to nearest 1/10th 
	     degree; 3) properly sort "from" line coordinates starting 
	     from northern-most and clockwise.  Bug fix for clo_direct.c -
	     undefined results when both points have the same longitude.  
	     Minor addition to cgr_segint.c - only return undefined 
	     intersecton point if both lines have same slope AND 
	     intercept.  Done, DP, (TP), 9/1/99.

u	yyy. Fixed problems reported by SPC in the data file search
	     routine.  Done, TL, (TP), 9/2/99.

u	zzz. Corrected problems when reading watch status lines when

	     the number exceeds the maximum.  Done, TL, (TP), 9/28/99.

w	a1i. Updated N-AWIPS to Patch5.4.3.w.  Done, TP, (TP), 10/4/99.

w	a1j. Fixed problem 221.2:  When using delete point, if an isolated 
	     SIGMET is plotted then an area SIGMET without closing the 
	     convective SIGMET edit box, the red delete symbol changes from

n	l. This release makes the following changes/fixes:

		1)  Loop animation speed is improved when in product
		    generation.  The vgf file is no longer reloaded 
		    with each frame -- only if a change to the vgf 
		    file has occured.

		2)  Auto-update loads more efficiently, particularly 
		    in cases where more than one frame is to be 
		    loaded into to a loop. 

		3)  Drawing in product generation (with a frame loop 
		    loaded) no longer results in "burn-in" (vgf 
		    elements drawn to the background frame) to the 
		    frames when in roam or zoom.

		4)  A copy pixmap operation (done during frame 
		    replacement) now copies the master pixmap when 
		    product generation is active.

		5)  The watch box display list no longer tries to 
		    update when moving to a different frame in a 
		    frame loop.

	   Done, ES, (TP), 3/31/99.

	   wider and the color is magenta.  Done, ES, (TP), 4/6/99.

n	o. Added to the seek function the ability to find the distance 
	   between two points when you click and drag.  Done, SL, (TP),
	   4/7/99.

n	p. Fixed the intermittent problem with being unable to select 
	   some or all vgf elements after performing a restore.  Fixed
	   problem where pushbuttons created with more than one pixmap 
	   collapsed on some OSes when made insensitive.  Made 
	   modifications to Nxm library functions to address IRIX 6.5 
	   compiler warnings.  Done, ES, (TP), 4/7/99.

	    in roam.  Done, SL, (TP), 5/12/99.

p	ee. Fixed numerous problems with the Look-up Tables when model
	    data is in the sequence.  The following sequences fail in 
	    the current operational software:

		1.  sat/rad/model/rad
		2.  sat/model-rad/sat
		3.  rad-fade/model/rad
		4.  rad/model-sat-fade/rad

	    Also, the color enhancement pop-up window did not always
	    reflect the actual Look-up Table applied.  Two known
	    occurrences are:

		1.  Any time the LUT is modified between a non-model 
	   		image and a model-image combination.

		2.  If the radar enhancement is modified, say to
			osf_rad8, then load satellite, then return
			to radar.

	    Done, TP, (TP), 5/12/99.

p	ff. Bug fix -- the locator had VOR and Anchor points 
	    reversed.  Done, DP, (TP), 5/13/99.

	    5/19/99.

p	jj. This release treats (not cures) a fatal bug in Nmap on
	    HPUX platforms.  The bug occurs when image and model data 
	    are loaded (image dominant).  After an auto-update, if the
	    model data is toggled to dominant, the application crashes.
	    Done, ES, (TP), 5/21/99.

p	kk. Removed unnecessary logic as a result of loading all images
	    via image_loadData as opposed to previously where if model 
	    data existed, images were loaded via mdl_loadData.  Done,
	    TP, (TP), 5/21/99.

p	ll. Added a check for when GDFILE is set in a restore file.
	    If GDFILE is in the restore file, the value in the file is
	    used.  Otherwise the model name is used as GDFILE.  Also,
	    modified all restore files for wam, nww3, and NEWwave to
	    add -1 line position for TITLE parameter.  Done, SJ, (TP), 
	    5/25/99.

q	mm. Fixed MODEL title when more than one GDFILE present in
	    restore file.  Done, TP, (TP), 5/28/99.

q	nn. Fixed some LUT problems.  If a user swithed between 
	    reflectivity and another radar type the wrong LUT would be 
	    applied.  Also, if the user faded the second radar image 
	    type the previous LUT would be reapplied.  Done, TP, (TP),
	    6/1/99.

q	oo. This release fixes two print bugs in nmap.  When printing 
	    "All" frames, model data was printing all the frames on the
	    same page, and all other data was printing an extra page.
	    Done, ES, (TP), 6/1/99.

q	pp. Some clean up to the auto-update.  Removed check on the file
	    modification time and now relies on the file name only to 
	    establish chronological order.  Done, ES, (SS), 6/4/99.

q	qq. Created a title for WATCH_WARN.  The title time is the
	    current time in GEMPAK format.  Done, AH, (TP), 6/7/99.

q	rr. Fix watch/warn title plot from delivery 018qq.  Done,
	    AH, (TP), 6/8/99.

	    in any order.  Done, SL, (TP), 6/28/99.

s	ww. Added a button to the MAP pop-up to toggle on and off
	    the display of the image.  The default is set to off.
	    Done, SL, (SS), 7/6/99.

s	xx. Added ability to edit the attributes of the Watch/Warn
	    data type.  The user can change colors, labeling, and
	    warning marker type by clicking on the edit button in
	    the data (Frame Set Definition) window.  Also, changed
	    the data dialog to only allow one instance of the
	    Watch/Warn data type.  Done, SJ, (SS), 7/6/99.

s	yy. Increased max # of groups from 25 to 50 and the max # of
	    products from 50 to 75 for NMAP model display access.
	    Done, GG, SS, (TP), 7/12/99.

	     for the hurricane track product to vgf file name.  Done,
	     HZ, (TP), 9/3/99.

v	ccc. Increased the number of models allowed in the user interface
	     for NMAP from 30 to 60.  Done, SJ, (TP), 9/13/99.

v	ddd. Modified the plot order of data sources to ensure that model
	     data is always plotted first, or immediately after any image
	     source.  This ensures that the model does not overwrite any
	     sources such as obs.  Done, ES, (TP), 9/13/99.

v	eee. Added cloud height button in nmap main window.  Built cloud 
	     height window.  Done, HZ, (TP), 9/24/99.

	     and return the resulting file name.  Done, SJ, (TP), 10/14/99.

w	iii. Added a check for optionally executing a program specific
	     function when choosing a LUT from the enhancement selection
	     window. (This is in support of the new NMAP2 and has no
	     effect on running the current NMAP.)  Done, SJ, (TP), 10/14/99.

w	jjj. Reorganized the two control buttons in cloud height window.
	     Fixed Problem 221.S1.  Done, HZ, (TP), 10/14/99.

	     storm names from the decoded hurricane advisory data files.
	     Done, SJ, AH, (TP), 10/19/99.

w	lll. This is the first cut at nmap2.  It introduces multiple loop 
	     capability to nmap and loads the frames from the latest to
	     the earliest, keeping the latest in view while all other
	     pixmaps are loading (out of sight to the user).  Done,
	     ES, (TP), 10/19/99.

w	mmm. Added cloud height to nmap2.  Also added the frame time 
	     display (lower left of main window).  Done, ES, (TP),

	     and AIX.  Changed size of the dominant toggle buttons on frame
	     set definition window.  Done, HZ, (TP), 11/3/99.

w	rrr. Added timeline updating to auto-update.  Fixed a bug in the 
	     timeline that resulted in unselected frame times being displayed
	     on some platforms ((aix4, linux2, irixX).  Done, ES, (TP), 
	     11/9/99.

	     RESTORE operation (nmap and nmap2).  Fixed the crash in nmap2 when 
	     changing maps with no data loaded and product generation active 
	     (and element(s) drawn).  Improved data loading when product 
	     generation is active (nmap2) by displaying the loaded vg file 
	     immediately after the data is loaded.  Previously the vg file
	     was displayed after all the data was loaded.  Cleaned up the
	     XW driver; one file is deleted, and a debug statement is removed
	     from another.  Done, ES, (TP), 1/19/00.

y	a2c. Increased the sizes of map overlay toggle buttons for Motif 2.1.
	     Done, HZ, (TP), 1/20/00.

y	a2d. Corrected Problem 265.2:  If a set time contains no data, a 
	     "Dominant Data Not Available" window pops up. Upon selecting okay,
	     the time line is all blank but the current time button is blue.
	     One must actually select the "current time" button to restore 
	     the time line.  Corrected Problem 265.3:  Obs type allows the
	     user to set a time but nothing happens after setting a time.
	     Done, HZ, (TP), 1/20/00.

y	a2e. Fixed bug on hpux that occurred when the user selected and loaded
	     data, then popped the dataw window back up and selected "Clear".

	     rounding scheme in cloformat.c more generic.  Done, AH, DP,
	     (TP), 1/21/00.

y	a2j. Fixed a bug in zoom under nmap2.  Zooming when only product
	     generation is active (i.e., no data is loaded), zoomed to a blank
	     map.  The vg objects were not visible unless REFRESH was clicked.
	     Done, ES, (TP), 1/24/00.

y	a2k. Fixed problem with locator and seek positions being incorrect after
	     an autoupdate with multiple loops.  Done, SL, (TP), 1/24/00.

	     Done, ES, (TP), 1/27/00.

y	a2m. Fixed a fatal seek bug in nmap/nmap2 (#273, P2).  Selecting a point
	     that was sufficiently far removed from a known station (on a world
	     or hemispheric map) caused a crash.  Fixed seek problem in nmap2.
	     Seek in nmap2 didn't warp to the location of a selected city.  The
	     code to peform the warp was ommented out in nmap2, relative to nmap.
	     Done, ES, (TP), 1/27/00.

z	a2n. Fixed #275, P1 -- crash on sunOS5, irix5, irix6.  Done, ES, (TP),

	     (2) added iret = G_NORMAL in the declaration of nmap_mapw.c,
	     (3) malloc(len) -> malloc(len+1) in nmap_roamw.c, (4) if
	     nprods < 2, added a return to gtbl_sortProd in nmap_gtbl.c.
	     Done, MLI, (TP), 2/16/00.

z	a2v. Added the ability to enter a point in degrees-minutes in the
	     SEEK text box.  The point is converted to lat. lon. in the
	     text display.  Done, AH, (TP), 2/16/00.

z	a2w. Fixed the projection related problems in nmap2, including
	     problem reports 227:2, 227:3, 227:6, 270:1, and 273:1.
	     Done, ES, (TP), 3/3/00.

z	a2x. Seek changes:  1) Set default Lat/Lon to none; 2) If the "Limit" is 
	     reduced, e.g. to 1, then the scoll list, should shrink down.
	     1 = lower limit (default) and 5 = upper limit. 3) Eliminate the
	     "State" and "Last Point" buttons.  Done, HZ, (TP), 3/8/00.

z	a2y. Added the "Set Time" functionality to nmap2.  Note that when a
	     time is set auto update is switched to OFF.  A window title
	     rename for one instance of the vector attribute edit window is

z	a2z. Created new popup windows to allow the user to change the
	     attributes of the miscellaneous data types (i.e., WTCH, WARN,
	     VGF, etc.)  Modified the table miscset.tbl to contain better
	     information for creating the popups.  Removed the type parameter
	     from the LINE and ARRW types in miscset.tbl.  Done, SJ, (TP), 
	     3/13/00.

z	a3a. Fixed the LUT bug that prevented selecting an enhancement file
	     for a rad/sat image in a loop following a loop with a rad/sat image.
	     This bug was introduced with the recent projection fix.  Also
	     fixed the LUT setting in conjunction with auto-update.  The visible
	     image file will be momentarily confused during an auto-update, but 
	     will reset itself to the correct colour at the end of the update. 
	     Done, ES, (TP), 3/15/00.

z	a3b. Removed the Wipe button from the main Nmap2 window.  Also included
	     is a fix to the linux2 group crash bug.  Done, ES, (TP), 3/15/00.

	     segments indicate the order in which the information
	     is written to the file.  If the order is incorrect,
	     the user may click to UPDATE button and the ordering
	     will change.  This step can be repeated until the
	     proper order is obtained.  This modification addresses
	     the inproper order problem that sometimes occurs with

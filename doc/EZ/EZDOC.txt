			    GEMPAK-5.2 EZ scripts

	This document describes how to set up and run the GEMPAK EZ scripts.  
These scripts allow the user to quickly produce a GEMPAK plot of various 
meteorological fields.  NOTE:  This document is for running the ezscripts
with version 5.2 of GEMPAK.  This version provides looping and multiple 
windows. 

	To run any of the EZ scripts, the user needs only type the name of the 
script at the UNIX prompt.  The script will prompt you for all necessary 
parameters.  You can short cut the prompting by supplying the necessary 
parameters on the command line.  That is, after typing the name of the desired 
script but BEFORE hitting the enter key, type the necessary parameters 
seperated by spaces.  For example:

		ezrelh 700 

	There are two "set up" programs, ezset and ezarea which are used 
infrequently to specify the gridded data file and the area of interest to use.  
Once set, the user may run the remaining scripts as often as desired.  Note
that you need to run these FIRST to initially set up your display map
and gridded data source.

	Most of the EZ scripts display the data in plan view.  Some require a 
level or levels to be input by the user.  There are also cross section, 
time-height section, and sounding scripts which require the user to input 
the location of the section or sounding.  See below for more information.


****** IMPORTANT ******

	Note that you should ALWAYS run the GEMPAK command gpend when you're 
all done examining data.  gpend removes the GEMPAK X window from you screen. 
DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW WITH THE X-WINDOW WIDGET (the button on the upper left 
corner of the window).
		
gpend -		This is actually a GEMPAK program that you should ALWAYS use
		to delete the GEMPAK X-window from your display.  You can use
		the same window for multiple EZ scripts and only need to use 
		gpend when you're all done examining data.

VERTICAL Scripts

	Vertical EZ scripts require that the user specify the location of 
the sounding, time-height section, or spatial cross section.  There are 
two ways to accomplish this.  The user can 
	
	1) Enter the 3-character station identifier(s) or 
	2) Graphically select the locations using the mouse on a map/field 
         window that has already been generated using a different ez script.  
	
In the first case, the user merely runs the desired vertical EZ script, such 
as ezprof, and enters the station ID(s) when prompted.  You can also supply 
the station ID(s) on the command line.  See below for the syntax and examples.
In the second case, the user would first have run a plan-view (horizontal) EZ 
script such as ezfront and have a display on the screen of frontogenesis.  
Without removing that graphic, the user then runs ezprof to generate a 
sounding from the gridded data.  Once the script is running and all required 
parameters have been input, place the cursor on the graphics screen.  When 
the cursor changes from an arrow to a + sign, you can select the location(s) 
with the mouse.  For a single point, just click the left button at the 
desired location.  For a line (spatial cross section), press and hold the 
left mouse button at the location where you want the left side of the 
cross section to start.  Then "drag" the line to the desired location 
and release the left mouse button to select the cross section.

List of scripts and descriptions


 EZ250

 This script will plot the 250 mb isotachs, heights and winds for
 all of the times for the given model.

	Syntax:  ez250


 EZ500

 This script will plot the 500 mb absolute vorticity and heights
 for all of the times for the given model.

	Syntax:  ez500


 EZ700

 This script will plot the 700 mb vertical motions, RH and heights
 for all of the times for the given model.

	Syntax:  ez700


 EZ850

 This script will plot the 850 mb temperatures, heights and winds for
 all of the times for the given model.

	Syntax:  ez850


 EZAREA

 This script allows the user to graphically define the area to view for all
 subsequent EZ scripts.  By default, the user is shown a map of North America
 in medium resolution. The user may also specify the projection, graphics
 area and map resolution by answering the script's prompts.

 When the mouse cursor becomes a + sign while on the graphics window, press
 and hold down the left button on one corner of the desired area.  Then
 "stretch" the rubber rectangle to the desired size and release the left
 button to select the area.  This area will now be used for ALL EZ scripts
 until EZAREA is run again.

 EZAREA does not take any command line arguments.

 	Syntax:  ezarea


 EZCROSS.CSI

 This script displays a spatial cross section of theta-e, rh and momentum
 surfaces.

 The end points for the cross section may be chosen by (1) entering the 
 station IDs for two stations; or (2) graphically selecting the locations
 using the mouse on a map/field window that has already been generated using
 a different EZ script.

 The user must enter the fcst_hour and the left and right stations, as above.

	Syntax:   ezcross.csi fcst_hour [left_stn right_stn]

	Examples: ezcross.csi 00 ( The script will prompt for station
				   IDs or graphical selection. )
		  ezcross.csi 18 GEG ELP

 EZCROSS.IPV

 This script displays a cross section of theta, isotachs and potential
 vorticity.

 The end points for the cross section may be chosen by (1) entering the 
 station IDs for two stations; or (2) graphically selecting the locations
 using the mouse on a map/field window that has already been generated using
 a different EZ script.

 The user must enter the fcst_hour and the left and right stations, as above.

       Syntax:   ezcross.ipv fcst_hour [left_stn right_stn]

       Examples: ezcross.ipv 00 ( The script will prompt for station
                                  IDs or graphical selection. )
                 ezcross.ipv 18 GEG ELP

 EZCROSS.KINEM

 This script displays a cross section of circulation vectors, vertical motion

                 ezcross.kinem 18 GEG ELP

 EZCROSS.THTA

 This script will plot a cross section of circulation vectors, rh, theta
 and isotachs.

 The end points for the cross section may be chosen by (1) entering the

 using the mouse on a map/field window that has already been generated using
 a different EZ script.

 The user must enter the fcst_hour and the left and right stations, as above.

                 ezcross.thta 18 GEG ELP

 EZDELTA

 This script displays the 12 hour change of a given field along with the
 field itself.  If the user asks for the change in 700 mb temperature at 24-h,
 the script will compute the change between the 12- and 24-h 700 mb
 temperatures and display it, along with the 24-h temperature field.

 The user must supply the forecast time (from which 12 hrs will be subtracted
 to compute the difference), level, and a field.

	Syntax:   ezdelta fcst_hour level field

	Examples: ezdelta 24 700 temp
		  ezdelta 36 500 hght


 EZDIVQ

 This script displays the divergence of layer averaged Q-vectors along with
 the lapse rate through the same layer.

 The user must supply the script with the bottom and top pressure levels of
 the layer.  Note that the order is important.

	Syntax:  ezdivq lower_level upper_level

	Example: ezdivq 500 300


 EZDOC

 This script will create a user document from the README file and the headers
 of all of the scripts.

	Syntax:  ezdoc


 EZFRONT

 This script displays the frontogenesis function, wind barbs, and temperature
 for a given level.

 The user must supply the level.

!  GUITST is a simple and general program whose primary purpose is 
!  to assist programmers who want to test a relatively independent
!  module, such as a library module, before it can be used in an 
!  application program.  It is particularly suitable for testing modules 
!  contained in a popup window.  All the initializations including 
!  connection to GEMPAK have been done.  Programmers using GUITST need
!  to copy everything in the current to his testing directory.
!
!  The basic program consists of a drawing canvas and a menubar having
!  a single item, the 'Exit' button.  All interface between GUITST template
!  program and user's module is done through user_func() function in
!  user.c file.  A programmer can test his module by adding item(s) to 
!  the menubar by calling guitst_AddUserItem() in user_func().  The
!  programmer also needs to call guitst_Display() to display current
!  pixmap and guitst_GetCanvasId() to get widget id of the drawing canvas.

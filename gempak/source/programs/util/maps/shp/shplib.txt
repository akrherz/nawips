				SHPLIB

   Library SHPLIB contains functions to process shapefiles (contains
   only point, line, and polygon), and produce SSF (Standard Sequential
   Format) formatted map files, as well as bound, bound info, and 
   station table files used by NAWIPS programs.

   Files contained in the library SHPLIB can be divided into two groups:
   generic to the different types of shapefile and related to the types
   of shapefile. When a new type of shapefile is added, only those 
   files that are related to the types of shapefile are necessary to be
   changed. These files are:

	shpprm.h
	shpmtyp.c
	shpgkey.c
	shpbhdr.c
	shpcbnd.c
	shpctbl.c

   First, the new type has to be defined in shpprm.h. For example, the
   AWIPS Countes is defined as MAP_CNTY, and the Public Forecast Zones
   is defined as MAP_ZONE. 

   Second, shpmtyp.c has to be modified to detect the new type, and 
   shpgkey.c be modified to return a new key.

   Third, new functions have to be added into shpbhdr.c, shpcbnd.c and
   shpctbl.c to create bound, bound info, and station table specific 
   to this new type.

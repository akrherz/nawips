GPTEXT draws the contents of a text file to the output device.

INPUT PARAMETERS


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    GPTEXT draws text read from an ASCII text file to the
    output device driver. If the input file is LOGO, the NOAA
    logo will be plotted.  The logo can be plotted in either
    full color or monochrome. The NOAA logo is also plotted if
    "NOAA" is entered for the file name. The NWS logo is plotted
    if "NWS" is entered.

    The text location TXTLOC is given as the X and Y values
    in the Normalized coordinate system or Map coordinate
    system if a '#' is prefixed before the X and Y values.
    To use map coordinates, the map projection must be 
    defined by another GEMPAK application such as GPMAP.

    COLUMN is the number of columns the text will be divided
    into within a panel.

EXAMPLES

    1.  Draw the contents of the text file mytext.txt to the XW
	device.  Display the text at the location .1;.8.  Display
	in a single column.

	PANEL	 =  0
	COLORS   =  1
	TEXT	 =  1
	CLEAR	 =  yes
	DEVICE	 =  xw
	TXTFIL	 =  mytext.txt
	TXTLOC	 =  .1;.8
	COLUMN	 =  1

GDFRZL generates GFA FZLVLs in VG format from a scalar grid.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    GDFRZL create a VG file that contains GFA FZLVL elements.
    It draws contours from the grid and save the contours and
    labels into a temporary vg file. The the elements in the vg 
    file are converted to GFA FZLVLs.
    
    The only valid device is VG. For example:

		DEVICE = VG|gfa.vgf

    The default vg file is vgf.vgf.

    The FHR parameter specifies the forecast hour of the GFA.

    The Tag parameter is the GFA tag value.

    The STAT parameter is the GFA issuing statues.

    The LVLINCR parameter is used to round freezing level ranges.

    The freezing level ranges are computed on the first run. The
    following runs will use the same range information.

SNMOD moves selected sounding data from an input sounding file to 
an output sounding file.
   
  
INPUT PARAMETERS


 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    SNMOD takes data from a GEMPAK sounding file, SNFILE, and 
    writes it to an output GEMPAK sounding file, SNOUTF.
    This program can be used to subset the original dataset
    by time and/or stations and to change the levels and
    vertical coordinate.

    The output dataset may be either a merged or unmerged data
    set.  If the output file does not exist, a new file will be
    created by this program.  If a new file is created, MRGDAT
    will determine whether the output file will be a merged or
    unmerged dataset.  Note that an error will result if the
    input dataset is merged and the output dataset is unmerged.

    The value of SNPARM will be ignored if the output dataset is
    unmerged.  If a merged data file is to be created, SNPARM
    will specify the parameters to be included.  In this case,
    if SNPARM = DSET, the parameters in the input dataset will be
    used.  If the output file is an existing merged dataset, the
    parameters specified in SNPARM must be in the dataset.  In
    this case, if SNPARM = DSET, the parameters in the output file
    will be used.  Undecoded text (raw reports) may be included in
    the input file, but will not be moved to the output file.
  
    If the output file is to be created, the maximum number of 
    times and stations which can be stored in the file must be 
    specified in TIMSTN.  
  
    IDNTYP has been added to specify whether station numbers or
    station identifiers will be used in referring to stations.
    Generally, IDNTYP should be set to STNM to use station 
    numbers.  However, in datasets which do not have station
    numbers, or which have a single invalid number, character
    station identifiers must be used and IDNTYP must be set
    to STID.
  
  
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Put the mandatory data for stations in an area centered
        on IL at time 910819/1200 into a new unmerged sounding
        file, NEW.SND, which may contain 2 times and 150
        stations.

        SNFILE  =  gemdata:hrcbob.snd
        SNOUTF  =  new.snd
        SNPARM  =  dset
        AREA    =  il
        DATTIM  =  19/12
        LEVELS  =  man
        VCOORD  =  pres
        TIMSTN  =  2/150
        MRGDAT  =  no
        IDNTYP  =  stnm

    2.  Add the stations at time 910819/00 to the file created in
        example 1.

        DATTIM  =  19/00

    3.  Create an isentropic dataset containing the specified 
        parameters with levels every 5 degrees.  Include all the
        US stations.

        SNFILE  =  gemdata:hrcbob.snd
        SNOUTF  =  thta.snd
        SNPARM  =  thta;pres;mixr;uwnd;vwnd;psym
        AREA    =  @us
        DATTIM  =  all
        LEVELS  =  250-450-5
        VCOORD  =  thta
        TIMSTN  =  4/150
        MRGDAT	=  yes

MKELEV draws contour lines for topography.

INPUT PARAMETERS
    

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    MKELEV draws contour lines for topography using geopotential 
    hight field contained in a specified data filei and save the
    plot in a VG file.

    The attributes of the contour lines, including the color,
    line type, line width, and label frequency are specified
    in LINE.  The four attributes must be separated with slashes;
    semicolons separate the values for each attribute.  If the
    line type is set to a single negative number, negative
    contour values will have the absolute value of the line type
    and positive values will be solid.  If the label frequency 
    is set to a single number, n, then every nth value will be
    labeled.
    
    CINT specifies the contour interval, minimum value, and maximum 
    value separated with slashes.  A scaling factor may be entered 
    in SCALE. The data in the grid file will be multiplied by 
    10 ** SCALE before the contour levels are selected.  If no 
    contour interval is entered, a default value which will generate 
    5 to 10 contour levels will be selected.
 
    The SKIP parameter specifies the number of grid points to skip
    in generating contours.  For example, if SKIP = 1, every other
    point is used to generate the contours.

EXAMPLES

    1.  Draw topography contours every 4000 feet for the whole
        area covered by data on NAM model output.  Force the labels 
        to be drawn for each contour with no gaps for the label 
        itself and each contour to be closed.

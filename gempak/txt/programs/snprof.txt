INPUT PARAMETERS


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

    SNPROF draws profiles of upper air data.  

    Any two parameters that can be computed from the data set can
    be plotted.  These parameters are specified in SNPARM.
    The profiles' colors, line types, and widths are 
    specified in LINE.  Markers identifying the data points
    can be plotted by setting a color in MARKER.

    Profiles are plotted in an animation sequence if more than
    one station and/or time is specified in AREA and DATTIM, 
    respectively. 
 
    The type of y axis is specified in PTYPE.  LIN, LOG, STUVE,
    and SKEW are all valid.  Note that SKEW is only valid when
    plotting temperature vs. pressure.  The bottom and top of
    the axis, along with an increment for labels, are set in
    YAXIS.  If the panel is changed to be less than the full
    screen, the default margins will often be too large.  The
    margins can be set explicitly in PTYPE.
 
    Winds are plotted in the right margin and can be specified in
    WIND.  There are three positions available for plotting winds.
    They are numbered 1 to 3, with 1 being the leftmost position.
    The location for the wind to be plotted is specified in WINPOS.
    The positions also apply to the station identifier, date/time
    and stability indices which are plotted above the diagram.
  
    Dry adiabats, moist adiabats and mixing ratio background 
    lines can be added to the diagram.  The attributes of these
    lines are specified in THTALN, THTELN, and MIXRLN.   
  
    If the color is set to 0, no lines will be plotted.  If the
    start, stop and increment are not set, defaults will be
    supplied.  Note that these lines can only be drawn on plots
    of pressure versus temperature.
 
    FILTER in this program determines whether the wind barbs are
    filtered.

EXAMPLES

    1.  Plot a Skew T chart for HAT for all of the times in the
	file.  Display the Showalter index, the bulk Richardson
	number, CAPE, the Lifted index and the K index.  Plot TMPC
	in color 2 using a solid line with width of 3.  Plot DWPC
	in color 3 using a dashed line with width of 3.  Include
	theta, theta-e, and mixing ratio lines.  Plot wind barbs
	in color 6 in position 1.

	SNFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.snd
	DATTIM	 =  all
	AREA	 =  @hat
	SNPARM	 =  tmpc;dwpc
	LINE	 =  2;3/1;3/3
	PTYPE	 =  skewt
	VCOORD	 =  pres
	STNDEX	 =  show;brch;cape;lift;kinx
	STNCOL	 =  1
	WIND	 =  bm6//2
	WINPOS	 =  1
	MARKER	 =  
	BORDER	 =  1
	TITLE	 =  1
	DEVICE	 =  xw

	TEXT	 =  1
	THTALN	 =  8/3/1
	THTELN	 =  23/1/1
	MIXRLN	 =  16/10/2

     2. Plot relative humidity with a logarithmic pressure axis.
        Plot the data from the surface to 200 mb. The theta,
	theta-e, and mixing ratio lines are turned off, and no
	stability indices are computed.

	SNFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.snd
	DATTIM	 =  all
	AREA	 =  @hat
	SNPARM	 =  relh

	STNCOL	 =  1
	WIND	 =  0
	WINPOS	 =  1
	MARKER	 =  
	BORDER	 =  1
	TITLE	 =  1
	DEVICE	 =  xw
	YAXIS	 =  1050/200
	XAXIS	 =  0/100/20
	FILTER	 =  no
	CLEAR	 =  yes
	PANEL	 =  0
	TEXT	 =  1
	THTALN	 =  
	THTELN	 =  
	MIXRLN	 =  

    3.  Plot equivalent potential temperature on the x axis vs.
        potential temperature on the y axis.  Display the data
	for the first time in the data file for HAT, ALB and BNA.
	Set the X axis to range from 310 to 360 Kelvin in increments
	of 10. Also, set the Y axis to ranged from 280 to 350
	Kelvin in increments of 10.

	SNFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.snd

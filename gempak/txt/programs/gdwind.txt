GDWIND displays a vector grid using wind barbs or arrows.
 
INPUT PARAMETERS

 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    GDWIND draws wind barbs or arrows at each grid point of a
    vector grid.  Vector plots can be drawn for any vector field
    computed using the GEMPAK grid diagnostic functions.  Vectors
    may be drawn in any valid GEMPAK projection and may be 
    overlaid on images.

    A list of times may be given in GDATTIM allowing animation
    of the plots.
       
    SKIP specifies the number of points to skip in both coordinate
    directions.  For example, SKIP = /1;2 will display winds at every
    other grid point in the x direction and every third grid point in
    the y direction.  SKIP = /0 displays winds at every grid point.
    Wind barbs or arrows can also be staggered by specifying negative
    values for SKIP. 

    IF M is entered as part of the wind symbol, winds will be
    displayed in m/s, unless the KNOTV operator has been specified
    in GVECT, in which case the winds will be displayed in knots.
    If K is entered in WIND, the wind is displayed in knots.
   
  EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Draw wind barbs in m/s in a staggered array.  The vector
        field is the gridded wind at 850 mb for the 18 hour forecast.
	The barbs are plotted as an overlay on the entire visible
	satellite image for 18Z.

	the GAREA to Rhode Island.  The satellite image is subset
	for the given area and the data is replotted.

    3.  Plot arrows for the temperature gradient at 850 mb.  Scale the
	data by 10**6.  Also, plot a reference vector with the label
	"degrees C / meter".  The display area is centered on New York.

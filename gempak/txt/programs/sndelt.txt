PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    SNDELT deletes data from a sounding data file.  The stations
    to be deleted are specified in AREA; the times to be deleted
    are given in DATTIM.

    If AREA is set to DSET or ALL, all the data present at the
    times in DATTIM will be deleted, along with the headers for
    those times.

  
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Delete all the data at time 920722/1200.
  
        SNFILE  =  92jul.snd
        DATTIM  =  920722/1200
        AREA    =  dset

    2.  Delete data at IAD for the most recent time in the file.

        SNFILE  =  realtime.snd
        DATTIM  =  last
        AREA    =  @iad

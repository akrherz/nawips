SFEDIT adds or changes data in a surface file using a sequential 
text file.
   
  
INPUT PARAMETERS


 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    SFEDIT adds information from a sequential text file to an 
    existing GEMPAK surface file.  The program may be used to add
    new data to a file or to change existing values.  The output
    file must already exist.

    The data to be added must reside in a text file, SFEFIL.  This 
    file can be created by specifying F as the output device in 
    GEMPAK program SFLIST or by generating the file with a text
    editor.  A text editor may be used to change the file. 

    The parameters to be edited must be specified at the beginning 
    of the edit file, for example:  PARM=TMPF;DWPF.  Only
    parameters stored in the output file can be edited.  Parameters 
    that have character values, such as WTHR, are actually stored
    as real numbers.  Thus, the numeric weather code must be used.  
    Station information, such as the latitude, SLAT, cannot be
    changed using this program.  Rather, these changes can be
    made using the GEMPAK program, SFSTNS.
      
    The data follow the parameter list.  Each data listing must
    include the time, followed by the station character or 
    numeric identifier followed by the data.  If data are 
    missing, the current missing data value, -9999., must be 
    used.  Blank fields will not be recognized.

    If a station or time does not exist in the output file it will 
    be added to the file.  If stations are added, the GEMPAK
    program SFSTNS can be used to add station latitudes, longitudes
    and elevations.


EXAMPLES

    1.  Change values of TMPF and DWPF in the file SFCDATA.DAT.
 
        SFEFIL  = sflist.fil
        SFFILE  = sfcdata.dat
 
        The file SFLIST.FIL follows.  Note that the title line 
        is ignored.

	PARM = TMPF;DWPF 

	STN  YYMMDD/HHMM 	TMPF	DWPF
	BWI  850426/0400       55.40   42.80
	SBY  850426/0400       62.62   55.40
	BGJ  850426/0400       55.40   42.80

       The program replaces the temperature and dewpoint for 
       stations BWI, SBY and NHK at the given time values in
       output file SFCDATA.DAT.

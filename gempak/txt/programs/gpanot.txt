PROGRAM DESCRIPTION                                                             
                                                                                
    This program will plot an object at any location on the graphic
    device. It uses Normal, Map and Grid coordinates. See the help
    file on the specific parameters, since the definitions change 
    for each shape specified.

EXAMPLES                                                                        
                                                                                
    1.  Plot the text string "This is plot 1" centered at normal
	coordinates .5;.5, in color 15, with a filled box of 
	color 25 around the text.

	DEVICE  = xw 
	PANEL   = 0
	SHAPE   = text
	INFO    = 1/3////c/hw/This is plot 1
	LOCI    = .5;.5
	LINE    = 15///25
	CTYPE   = f

    2.	Plot a square centered at grid location 40;23, with radius
	2 grid points, and rotated 45 degrees. Use color 8 for the 
	unfilled square, and use line type 5.

	SHAPE   = regpoly
	INFO    = 5/2/4/45
	LOCI    = @40;23
	LINE    = 8
	CTYPE   = c

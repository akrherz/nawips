SNHODO draws a hodograph of upper air data.

INPUT PARAMETERS


PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    SNHODO draws a hodograph which represents the vertical 
    distribution of the horizontal wind at a station.  The winds
    are plotted in meters/sec.

    The line color, line type, and width are specified in LINE.
    The marker color, type, and size are specified in MARKER.  
    The levels at which the line will be labeled are specified 
    in LEVELS; VCOORD specifies the vertical coordinate for 
    LEVELS.
 
    The x and y axis limits are specified in XAXIS and YAXIS.  If
    these values are blank, the axes will be scaled to the actual
    data.
  
EXAMPLES

    1.	Plot the hodograph for station CHH for the latest time in 
	the data set.  Label the hodograph every 100 mb from 1000 mb
	to 100 mb.  Use hardware font 2 for the text and display 
	the hodograph in a XW window named snhodo.

	SNFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/HRCBOB.SND
	AREA	 =  @chh
	LINE	 =  3
	MARKER	 =  1 
	BORDER	 =  1
	TITLE	 =  1
	XAXIS	 =  
	YAXIS	 =  
	LEVELS	 =  1000-100-100
	VCOORD	 =  pres
	DATTIM	 =  last
	CLEAR	 =  y
	DEVICE	 =  xw|snhodo
	PANEL	 =  0
	TEXT	 =  1/2/1/hw

    2.	Plot the CHH hodograph using height coordinates.
	Label every 2000 meters from 1000 meters to
	24000 meters.  Draw the x and y axes from -10 to
	40 meters/sec.
 
	SNFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/HRCBOB.SND
	AREA	 =  @chh
	LINE	 =  3
	MARKER	 =  1 
	BORDER	 =  1
	TITLE	 =  1
	XAXIS	 =  -10/40/10
	YAXIS	 =  -10/40/10
	LEVELS	 =  1000-24000-2000
	VCOORD	 =  hght
	DATTIM	 =  last
	CLEAR	 =  y
	DEVICE	 =  xw|snhodo
	PANEL	 =  0
	TEXT	 =  1/2/1/hw

	point within a grid.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    GDTHGT is a user contributed program that draws a
    vertical time section at a location in a grid field.
    The location is specified by setting GPOINT.  Gridded
    data are interpolated to the time-section plane at regular
    intervals of time specified in GDATTIM. 
  
    The grid vertical coordinate (GVCORD) may be PRES, THTA, or 
    HGHT, depending on what is available in the grid file.
    The vertical axis scaling, set in PTYPE, can be LIN,
    LOG, KAP or STUVE.  STUVE and KAP are the same; SKEWT may
    not be entered.  The plot aspect ratio and margins may also be
    entered in PTYPE.
  
    Vector fields may be specified in GVECT and displayed as
    arrows or barbs. For a wind vector field, the default is north
    relative direction. A "/G" indicates grid relative direction.
    The vector function CIRC cannot be computed for time sections.

    If M is entered in WIND, winds will be displayed in meters
    per second unless the KNOTV operator has been specified in
    GVECT, in which case the winds will be displayed in knots.
    IF K is entered in WIND, the wind is displayed in knots.
   
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Plot temperature in Celsius on a log-P chart on a
        time section for all times at BWI.  Plot the contours
        in color number 2, using thick, solid lines.  Plot wind
        barbs for the forecast wind.  Plot the chart to 50
        millibars using the default labels.  

	GPOINT	 =  bwi
	GDATTIM	 =  all
	GVCORD	 =  PRES
	GFUNC	 =  temp
	GVECT	 =  wnd
	GDFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/HRCBOB.GRD
	PTYPE	 =  log
	TAXIS	 =  
	YAXIS	 =  /50
	BORDER	 =  1
	LINE	 =  2/2/3/1
	CINT	 =  5
	WIND	 =  bm1
	TITLE	 =  1
	CLEAR	 =  YES
	SCALE	 =  999
	PANEL	 =  0
	DEVICE	 =  xw
	TEXT	 =  1/21//hw
   
    2.  Now, using the same file, plot a log pressure time 
        section of the vorticity advection.  Positive values
	are contoured with solid lines, negative values are
	contoured with dashed lines. Plot the wind in grid
	relative direction.

	GPOINT	 =  bwi
	GDATTIM	 =  all
	GVCORD	 =  PRES
	GFUNC	 =  adv(avor(obs);obs)
	GVECT	 =  wnd/G
	GDFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/HRCBOB.GRD
	PTYPE	 =  log
	TAXIS	 =  
	YAXIS	 =  /50
	BORDER	 =  1
	LINE	 =  2/-2/3/1
	CINT	 =  5
	WIND	 =  bm1
	TITLE	 =  1
	CLEAR	 =  YES
	SCALE	 =  999
	PANEL	 =  0
	DEVICE	 =  xw
	TEXT	 =  1/21//hw

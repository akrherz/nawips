SFMOD moves selected surface data from an input surface file to an 
output surface file.
   
  
INPUT PARAMETERS


 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    SFMOD takes data from an existing GEMPAK surface file,
    SFFILE, and writes the data into another existing surface
    file, SFOUTF.  This program can be used to subset the
    original dataset by time and/or stations and/or parameters.  

    This program will not create a new surface file.  The GEMPAK
    program, SFCFIL, can be used to create a surface file.  If the 
    parameters in the output file are not the same as the 
    parameters in the input file, the required parameter 
    conversions will be done.

    If a requested station or time is not in the output file, it 
    will be added to the file if there is room.  The number of
    times and stations that can be included in a file is specified
    by TIMSTN in SFCFIL.

    The parameter DATOUT can be used to set different times in the
    output file from those times listed with the parameter DATTIM.

    The parameter SFPARM can be used to specify which parameters
    in the output file are to be written.

 
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Put the data for all stations at the latest time in file 
        TEST.SFC into a file called LAST.SFC.
  
        SFFILE  =  test.sfc
        SFOUTF  =  last.sfc
        DATTIM  =  last
        AREA    =  dset

    2.  Put the data for stations in Maryland and Virginia for
        all times into the output data set.
 
        SFFILE  =  test.sfc
        SFOUTF  =  last.sfc
        DATTIM  =  all
        AREA    =  @md/@va

    3.  Put the data for stations in Maryland for 1100 - 1400 UTC
        into the output file with the new times from 1500 - 1800 UTC.
	Write only the temperature and dewpoint data to the output 
	file.

	SFFILE   = test.sfc
	SFOUTF   = last.sfc
	DATTIM   = 940513/1100;940513/1200;940513/1300;940513/1400
	DATOUT   = 0513/1500;0513/1600;0513/1700;0513/1800
	AREA     = @md
	SFPARM   = tmpf;dwpf

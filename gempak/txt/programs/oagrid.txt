OAGRID creates a GEMPAK grid file which can be used in a Barnes
objective analysis program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    This program allows the user to create a GEMPAK grid file
    which contains the information required to perform a Barnes
    objective analysis.
   
    The output grids will be evenly spaced latitude/longitude
    (CED) grids.  Three areas used by the objective analysis
    programs are defined in this program.  GRDAREA defines a
    region for the output grid.  The upper right corner 
    specified will be moved toward the lower left in order
    to align it on a grid point. 
  
    The second area, defined by EXTEND, is used to extend the
    grid area outward by some number of grid points.  This area
    is used as a first-pass grid area in the objective analysis.
    The default EXTEND values are 2,2,2,2. 
   
    DTAAREA defines the area over which station data will be
    input to the analysis.  Only data within the EXTEND area are
    used for the second pass.  If a value for DTAAREA is not
    specified, the EXTEND area will be used. 
  
    If values for the station spacing and grid spacings, DELTAN,
    DELTAX, and DELTAY, are all specified by the user, they are 
    stored in the grid file for use by the analysis programs.  If 
    any of these numbers is 0, a suggested station spacing is 
    computed using the station data from the file specified.  This 
    station spacing will be used to compute values for DELTAX and 
    DELTAY.  The computed station spacing is the average of the 
    average minimum station spacing and the uniform station 
    spacing.  These station spacing values are computed using the 
    stations reporting data for the first DATTIM.  The average 
    minimum station spacing is the average of the distances from 
    each station to its closest station.  The uniform spacing is 
    the spacing that would be found between stations if they were 
    evenly spaced over the data area. 

    GDCFIL can also be used to create grid files.  OAGRID creates
    only CED grids, but values for the grid spacing and station
    spacing are estimated from the input surface or upper air file.
    GDCFIL creates grid files for grids in any projection, but
    the grid spacing and station spacing must be input directly.
  
EXAMPLES
      
    1.	Create a surface grid file called hbobsfc.grd.  Use the 
	temperature and dewpoint in the surface file hrcbob.sfc to
	compute the station spacing.  The grid area is US; use 
	defaults for the remaining parameters.  Create a file which
	can contain up to 200 grids. 

	GDFILE	 =  hbobsfc.grd
	DELTAN	 =  0
	DELTAX	 =  0
	DELTAY	 =  0
	GRDAREA	 =  us
	EXTEND	 =  2;2;2;2
	DTAAREA	 =  
	SOURCE	 =  sf
	SNFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.snd
	SFFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.sfc
	SNPARM	 =  
	SFPARM	 =  tmpc;dwpc
	DATTIM	 =  last
	LEVELS	 =  850
	MAXGRD	 =  200

     2.	Create a upper-air grid file called hbobsnd.grd.  Use the
	temperature and dewpoint at 500 mb from the upper-air file 
	hrcbob.snd to compute the station spacing.  Create a file 
	which can contain up to 2000 grids.
 
	GDFILE	 =  hbobsnd.grd
	DELTAN	 =  0
	DELTAX	 =  0
	DELTAY	 =  0
	GRDAREA	 =  us
	EXTEND	 =  2;2;2;2
	DTAAREA	 =  us
	SOURCE	 =  sn
	SNFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.snd
	SFFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.sfc
	SNPARM	 =  tmpc;dwpc
	SFPARM	 =  tmpc;dwpc
	DATTIM	 =  last
	LEVELS	 =  500
	MAXGRD	 =  2000

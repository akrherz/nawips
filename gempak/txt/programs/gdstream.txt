GDSTREAM draws streamlines through a vector grid. 
 
INPUT PARAMETERS
 
    
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    GDSTREAM draws streamlines through any vector grid computed
    by the grid diagnostics package. The vector grid is specified 
    in GVECT.

    Streamlines are plotted in an animation sequence by specifying
    more than one time in GDATTIM.
   
    The line color, dash pattern and line width are set in LINE.  
    A map, title and latitude/longitude lines may also be included. 
    The size of the arrow heads may be controlled by specifying 
    the fifth value in WIND.

    The STREAM parameter controls several parameters dealing with 
    the overall streamline calculation and display.  "Lines" is a 
    real number multiplier which controls the number (density) of 
    streamlines drawn (default 1.0); "arrows" is a real number 
    multiplier which controls the number of arrowheads displayed 
    (default 1.5*lines); "stop" is a real number multiplier which 
    controls how close a streamline comes to another streamline 
    before it is stopped being drawn (default 0.5); "slow" is a 
    real number multiplier which controls the minimum vector speed 
    threshold for stopping a streamline (default 0.67); "scale" is 
    a real number multiplier which controls how much the input vector 
    field is scaled prior to streamline calculation (default 0.33).

 
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Draw streamlines through the gridded wind field at 850
        mb using color 3.  Add a North Polar Stereographic map
	in color 1 and line type 7 and a title in color 5.
	Center the graphics area on Ohio.

	GDATTIM	 =  f24
	GLEVEL	 =  850
	GVCORD	 =  pres
	GVECT	 =  wnd
	GDFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.grd
	GAREA	 =  oh-
	SATFIL	 =
	RADFIL	 =
	IMCBAR   =
	LINE	 =  3//2
	MAP	 =  1/7
	LATLON	 =  2/10/1/1/5;5
	TITLE	 =  5
	PANEL	 =  0
	TEXT	 =  1
	DEVICE	 =  xw
	PROJ	 =  nps
	CLEAR	 =  yes

    2.  Similar to 1), except for a global 1x1 degree dataset over the 
	Pacific Ocean, specifying the STREAM parameter to properly
	thin and display the field given the overall density of
	grid boxes.

	GDFILE   = $MODEL/fnl/fnl_96052800
	GDATTIM	 = f00
	GLEVEL	 = 250
	GAREA    = -25;-180;55;-45
	PROJ     = mer
	LATLON   = 31/12/2//10
	STREAM   = 0.4/0.8/3//
	WIND     = am1/2/3//0.8
	TITLE    = 31/-2/@ FNL ANALYSIS VALID ~         NHC MIAMI FLA

    3.  Clear the screen and draw the streamlines of the thermal
        wind.  Make the arrowheads 0.75 of the default size.
	Plot the streamlines in a second window named "window2".

	GDATTIM	 =  f24
	GLEVEL	 =  500:850
	GVCORD	 =  pres
	GVECT	 =  thrm
	GDFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/hrcbob.grd

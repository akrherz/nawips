SFSTNS modifies the station information in a surface file.
   
  
INPUT PARAMETERS


 
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    SFSTNS updates the station information in a GEMPAK surface 
    file.  The station information includes the character station
    identifier, STID, the station number, STNM, the latitude,
    SLAT, the longitude, SLON, the elevation, SELV, the state,
    STAT, and the country, COUN.

    This information must be stored in a fixed format in the table
    file specified in STNFIL.  See the default table for an example
    of the required format.  Station names may be included, but are
    not used.  The current default GEMPAK surface station table 
    for US, Canadian and Mexican stations is SFSTNS.TBL.

    ADDSTN is a logical parameter that indicates whether stations
    which are in the table file but not already in the surface file
    will also be added to the surface file, provided there is room
    for them. To create a surface data file with enough room to 
    allow for stations to be added, run the program SFCFIL. Set
    the second parameter for TIMSTN to be large enough to hold the 
    number of stations to be added to the surface file.

    IDNTYP governs whether station numbers, STNM, or character
    identifiers, STID, will be used to identify stations in the
    table.


EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Update surface file called SURF.DAT with station 
        information from MYSTN.DAT, adding stations that are not 
        already in the surface file.
 
        SFFILE  =  surf.dat
        STNFIL  =  mystn.dat
        ADDSTN  =  yes
        IDNTYP  =  stid

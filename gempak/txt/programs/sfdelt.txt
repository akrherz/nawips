PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    SFDELT deletes data from a surface data file.  The stations
    to be deleted may be specified in AREA; the times to be 
    deleted are given in DATTIM.

    If AREA is set to DSET or ALL, all the data present at the
    times in DATTIM will be deleted, along with the headers for
    those times.

  
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Delete all the data at time 920722/1200.
  
        SFFILE  =  92jul.sfc
        DATTIM  =  920722/1200
        AREA    =  dset

    2.  Delete data at BWI for the most recent time in the file.

        SFFILE  =  realtime.sfc
        DATTIM  =  last
        AREA    =  @bwi

GDLIST lists data from a scalar grid.
 
INPUT PARAMETERS
 

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
 
    GDLIST lists a diagnostic grid computed from the grids in a
    GEMPAK grid file.
   
    The data may be listed over a subgrid.  The variables GAREA 
    and PROJ specify the data subset area.  This area is only 
    approximate; the subgrid selected will cover the subset area.  
    GAREA must be specified as a geographic area, as an area 
    centered on a station, as latitude/longitude bounds or as
    DSET or GRID.  If DSET or GRID is chosen, the entire grid 
    will be printed.
 
    Output to the terminal or to a file will be 80 columns wide.
    If the output is sent to a file, the file will be named 
    gdlist.fil if no name is specified.
 
EXAMPLES

    1.	List the 850 mb dewpoint temperature for the 24 hour 
 	forecast time.  The data subset area is a zoomed area
	centered on New York.
 
	GDATTIM	 =  /f24
	GLEVEL	 =  850
	GVCORD	 =  PRES
	GFUNC	 =  dwpc
	GDFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/HRCBOB.GRD
	GAREA	 =  ny*
	PROJ	 =  lcc
	SCALE	 =  999
	OUTPUT	 =  T

    2.	Compute the divergence at 300 mb and list the output
	over the Eastern US.  Write the output to a file 
	called div.east.

	GDATTIM	 =  /f24
	GLEVEL	 =  300
	GVCORD	 =  PRES
	GFUNC	 =  div(wnd)
	GDFILE	 =  $GEMDATA/HRCBOB.GRD
	GAREA	 =  east
	PROJ	 =  lcc
	SCALE	 =  999
	OUTPUT	 =  f/div.east

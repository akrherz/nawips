GDPROF draws profiles of a scalar grid and/or a vector grid.
  
INPUT PARAMETERS 
  
    
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  
    GDPROF draws vertical profiles at a point.  Data from each 
    level in the grid file are interpolated to the point.
  
    GPOINT specifies the location for the profile.  It may be
    entered as a latitude and longitude separated with a semicolon,
    as a station character identifier or station number, or as a
    set of x and y grid points separated with a semicolon and
    preceded with an @.  The profile location may also be selected
    graphically with the CURSOR command.  The location of the
    profile is then selected by clicking on a horizontal map in 
    another GEMPAK XW window.

    Profiles are plotted in an animation sequence by specifying more
    than one time in GDATTIM.

    The vertical coordinate, set in GVCORD, can be PRES, THTA, or 
    HGHT.  The vertical axis type, set in PTYPE, can be LIN,
    LOG, KAP, or SKEW.  Only temperatures vs. pressure may be 
    plotted on a skew t plot.  The height-to-width ratio of the
    plot may be specified in PTYPE following a /.  If no value is
    entered, a value of 0 will be used.
 
    GFUNC is computed at every level in the data set.  No errors
    are returned if the function cannot be computed at any level,
    except at the surface.  If data at the surface cannot be 
    computed, a warning message is written and plotting continues.
    GVECT specifies a vector to be plotted in the right margin.

    If GFUNC is a temperature or dewpoint temperature, background
    lines of potential temperature, equivalent potential 
    temperature and mixing ratio can be displayed by specifying 
    THTALN, THTELN, and MIXRLN.  If these background lines are 
    requested and GFUNC is not a temperature, an error message 
    is generated.

    GVECT specifies a vector grid to be displayed as arrows or    
    barbs in one of three display columns on the right of the
    profile plot. For a wind vector field, the default is north
    relative direction. A "/G" indicates grid relative direction.
    The number of the column is specified in WINPOS.

    If M is entered in WIND, winds will be displayed in m/s unless
    the KNOTV operator has been specified in GVECT, in which case the
    winds will be displayed in knots.  If K is entered in WIND,
    the wind is displayed in knots.
   
EXAMPLES
 
    1.  Plot temperature in Celsius on a log P chart at IAD for
        the latest time in the file.  Label the Y axis from 1000 mb
        to 100 mb in increments of 100 mb.  Label the X axis from
        -40 degrees to +40 degrees in increments of 10 degrees.  Add
        all the background lines.  Plot wind barbs in the right margin.

    2.  Overlay the dewpoint for IAD. Do not redraw the background
	lines. Plot the wind in grid relative direction.

    3.  Clear the screen and plot the vorticity at BWI in
        color number 2 using a dashed line.  Do not plot any
        winds.  Have the graph plot in a second window named
	"profile2".

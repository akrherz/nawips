                Surface Airways Decoder (RA) Library


The RA library contains subroutines to decode and store surface airways
reports.

The airways decoder must have access to individual airways reports.
RA_GRPT extracts reports from bulletins.

Before the report can be decoded, the subroutine RA_GFLD must be called.
This subroutine breaks the report into parts and saves them in a common
area which can be accessed by the other subroutines.  RA_RHDR can then
be called to get the report header information.  RA_DECD decodes the
rest of the bulletin.

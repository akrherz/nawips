               Synoptic-Ship-Buoy Decoder (RS) Library


The RS library contains subroutines to decode and store WMO SYNOP
reports (standard format and US variants), buoy reports, ship reports,
and US CMAN reports.

Because some reports do not include the time of the observation or
certain code groups, the decoder must have access to the the entire
bulletin, or the necessary information must be supplied along with the
report.

The main subroutines are:

   RS_DHDR	Decode the header of a bulletin
   RS_DLN2	Decode the second line of a bulletin
   RS_GRPT	Extract next observation from a bulletin
   RS_DECO	Decode observation


Given a bulletin, RS_DHDR and RS_DLN2 are called once, and then RS_GRPT
and RS_DECO are looped through until the end of the bulletin is reached.

In addition, the subroutine RS_REAL is available to select desired
elements from the decoded observation and load them into a real array,
which may then be written to a GEMPAK file.  The elements, and their
order, are input parameters which should in general be read from a file.
Available elements are, of course, limited to elements contained in the
raw observation.  For example, station latitude and longitude is present
in ship observations but not synoptic observations.

The program TESTRS is included for debugging purposes and to illustrate
a typical calling sequence.  The program reads pseudo-bulletins from a
file (using RS_RFIL) and sends them off to the decoder.

The subroutines contained in decode_sm.f are designed to be called by
the UNIDATA LDM to load synoptic, ship, and buoy data into GEMPAK data
files in real time.

The following table lists the elements returned by RS_DECO, and the
units they are translated into by RS_REAL.

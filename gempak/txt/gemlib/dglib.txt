The DIAGNOSTIC GRID package provides subroutines to perform
diagnostic computations on gridded fields.  DG_GRID computes scalar 
quantities; DG_VECR and DG_VECT compute vector quantities in
grid relative and north relative coordinates, respectively.
 
The diagnostics package must be initialized each time new grid files
are to be accessed.  Usually, DG_OFIL will be called to open the grid
files and perform the initialization.  If only one file is to be
opened, DG_INIT may be called instead.
 
DG_GRID, DG_VECR and DG_VECT require the date/time, vertical level,
vertical coordinate and grid diagnostic function that were input by
the user.  Although input and intermediate grids may be either scalars
or vectors, the output for DG_GRID must be a scalar, and for DG_VECR
or DG_VECT must be a vector.

The graphics library is used to simplify and standardize GEMPLT
library calls.  Routines to initialize graphics, to set the
graphics device and projection, and to draw maps and titles are
included. 

GG_MAPS is used to define both the projection type and graphics
area.  It can be used for map, graph, and satellite overlay
projections.  The current valid projections are listed in the
documentation for GG_MAPS.  Details for defining map projections
can be found in the GEMPLT documentation for GSMMAP and GSMPRJ.

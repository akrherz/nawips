The character translation library contains functions to convert 
numeric codes into character strings and vice versa.  The functions 
which output character data are called by the GEMPAK parameter 
conversion (PC) library.  Since all data in GEMPAK files must be 
stored as real values, functions to translate character data to 
numeric codes are included for use in data ingest programs.  
When creating a GEMPAK file, the numeric names MUST be used.

Several methods for storing surface weather reports are available.
The parameter names and conversion functions are included in the
following table.  For new files, WNUM should be used.

   Data Type       Char Name   Num Name    N-->C Conv   C-->N Conv
----------------   ---------   --------    ----------   ----------
General weather       WCOD       WNUM        PT_WCOD      PT_WNUM
METAR coded weather   WCMT       WNUM        PT_WNMT     (PT_WCMT)
WMO weather           WTMO       WWMO        PT_WTMO

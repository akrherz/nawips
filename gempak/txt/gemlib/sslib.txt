               System Services (SS) Library 


The system services library contains machine-dependent system-
service calls in order to isolate them for conversion to other 
machines.

The routines SS_GLUN and SS_FLUN have been replaced by FORTRAN 
standard routines, FL_GLUN and FL_FLUN.

SS_IRET translates the IOSTAT return from a FORTRAN I/O call into
a GEMPAK FL error number.

SS_GSYM returns the value of a VMS symbol.  It is only used in
the TAE (IP) library to determine whether the user is in the TAE
or not.

SS_GTIM returns the current system clock time in GEMPAK format. 
It is used in real-time data decoders to complete the bulletin
time.

The subroutines SS_CURS and SS_PAGE allow the programmer control
over the output display.  They are not generally called by GEMPAK
programs and can be replaced by subroutines which do nothing.  
SS_WAIT is included for convenience.  The FL routines that use
SS_WAIT are likely to need rewriting for non-VMS systems, so it is 
possible that SS_WAIT also can be replaced by a dummy subroutine
in ports to non-VMS systems.

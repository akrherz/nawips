The FL library contains subroutines to access direct access files,
sequential files, and table files.  The open and create subroutines
return a logical unit number that is used in subsequent calls to
reference each file.

When opening a file, the file name may include an environment variable.
In addition, if the file name includes '^' as its first character, no
case conversions on the file name are attempted.  Without this
indicator, when the file name cannot be found as given, the name is
converted to lower-case characters and an additional test is made for
the file's existence.

A table file is a sequential file that may include comment records.  A
comment record is any record where the first non-blank  character is an
exclamation point ('!').  The table open subroutine skips the leading
comment records.  Table files may be created using a text editor.

Direct access files may be created using FL_DCRE.  The subroutines
FL_DOPN and FL_DSOP open existing direct access files.  FL_READ and
FL_WRIT are provided to read and write data in direct access files.

The subroutine FL_CLOS, and its relatives, are provided for closing any
file opened by an FL open subroutine.

Each of the FL subroutines returns a condition code, IRET, that is the
GEMPAK file error number.  This error number can be printed using
ER_WMSG.

             Input Parameter (IP) Library 


The IP library provides an easy interface to all of the GEMPAK 
subroutines. 

If a program is to obtain any variables from the interface, IP_INIT 
must be called first.  This subroutine initializes the GEMPAK user
interface.  The program can then obtain input parameter values using 
the subroutines IP_STR or IP_LOG.  

When the IP library is first called, parameters are initially set to
the values stored in the local file GEMGLB.NTS.  If this file is not 
present, it will be created and defaults from the global file 
$GEMNTS/GEMGLB.NTS will be used.  

IP_DYNM is called by most GEMPAK programs to allow new parameters
to be entered and the program to be re-executed.

IP_EXIT must be the last IP subroutine called when exiting a program.
It updates GEMGLB.NTS with the current variable settings.   If a program 
is terminated prematurely (e. g., by using CTRL-C), GEMGLB.NTS will not 
be updated.

All errors from the interface are printed when they are encountered by an
IP subroutine.

The following commands can be entered while in the interface; each calls
a particular IP subroutine:

	LIST 		list values for program parameters
	LIST PARM 	list value for parameter PARM 
	DISPLAY		list values and definitions of program parameters
	DISPLAY PARM	list value and definition of parameter PARM  
	HELP		Types HELP information on the screen
	HELP NAME	Types HELP information for program or parameter NAME
	PHELP [NAME]	Same as HELP, but the output is paged
	PARM = xyz	Assign value xyz to PARM
	PARM = &PARM2	Assign value of PARM2 to PARM
	RESTORE [FILE]	Recalls parameter values stored by SAVE [FILE]
	SAVE [FILE]	Save values of parameters in FILE.NTS	
	WSAVE [FILE]	Save values of parameters except file name in FILE.NTS
	CURSOR PARM	Assign value to PARM based on mouse button input
	LUTR/LUTS FILE	Loads a radar/satellite color look-up table
	WINDOW NAME	Activates, pops, and restores window information
	CLOSE NAME	Closes the window specified by NAME
	VERSION		Displays the version number of GEMPAK
	RUN		Run the program
	EXIT		Exit the program
	
The following commands allow manipulation of an existing animation sequence:

	;LOOP		Starts forward animation of the loaded sequence
	;REVERSE	Starts backward animation of the loaded sequence
	;STEP		Steps one frame forward
	;BACK		Steps one frame backward
	;#		Sets the dwell rates to group #

The objective analysis library performs general objective analysis 
functions. 

Three areas are defined in the objective analysis programs:
     
   GRID             Grid area      Computed grid area
   EXTEND           Extend grid    Grid area extended for first pass
   DATA             Data area      Data subset area.

These areas are specified by the lower left and upper right corners.
If the grid projection is not a latitude/longitude (CED) projection,
the range for the grid or extend area may not be identical with the
range in GRID or EXTEND.

Information about the grid area is obtained from the grid navigation
block which is stored in the grid file.  The data area and extend
area are stored in the analysis block.  Two types of analyses blocks
are available.  The contents of these blocks are:

WORD           CONTENTS for type 1         CONTENTS for type 2
-----          -------------------         -------------------
  1            type = 1.0                  type = 2.0
  2            DELTAN                      DELTAN
  3            DELTAX                      IEXTND (1)
  4            DELTAY                      IEXTND (2)
  5            GAMMA (not used)            IEXTND (3)
  6            GBNDS (1)                   IEXTND (4)
  7            GBNDS (2)                   GBNDS  (1)
  8            GBNDS (3)                   GBNDS  (2)
  9            GBNDS (4)                   GBNDS  (3)
 10            EBNDS (1)                   GBNDS  (4)
11-13          EBNDS (2-4)                 EBNDS  (1-3)
14-17          DBNDS (1-4)                 EBNDS  (4), DBNDS (1-3)
 18                                        DBNDS  (4).

These variables have the following meanings:
 
               DELTAN  -  station spacing (degrees)
               DELTAX  -  spacing in x direction (degrees)
               DELTAY  -  spacing in y direction (degrees)
               IEXTND  -  number of points to extend grid
               GBNDS   -  grid area corners
               EBNDS   -  extend grid area corners
               DBNDS   -  data subset corners.

Note that analysis type 1 assumes that the grid projection is CED.

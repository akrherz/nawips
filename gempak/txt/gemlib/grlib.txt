The grid support library subroutines allow manipulation of
information in GEMPAK grid files.  Subroutines are available to
create and decode analysis and navigation block information.  Also
included are subroutines to open grid files, set the grid
navigation in GEMPLT, check grid boundaries, and define contour
levels. 

GR_LIST is available to list all the grids in a file.  In the
past, this subroutine would list grids based upon partial grid 
specifications.  Currently, it lists all the grids in a file.

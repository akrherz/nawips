                    String (ST) Library 


The GEMPAK string library provides subroutines to simplify handling
character strings.  These subroutines are used extensively
throughout GEMPAK. 
 
Basic routines convert strings to upper or lower case (ST_LCUC and 
ST_UCLC), determine the length without trailing blanks (ST_LSTR), 
remove leading spaces (ST_LDSP), and check for alphanumeric characters
(ST_ALNM). 
 
The routines ST_C2C, ST_C2I, and ST_C2R separate a character string 
into arrays of characters, integers or reals.  Separators are any 
non-alphanumeric character, except period, plus, minus, or 
asterisk. 
 
The routines ST_CLST, ST_ILST, and ST_RLST also separate lists
into arrays.  In this case, the separator must be specified (and
may not be a blank) and a default value is inserted for
unspecified values.  These subroutines are especially useful for
decoding GEMPAK input parameters and are preferred to the subroutines
described in the last paragraph. 

The routines ST_INCH, ST_RLCH, ST_NUMB, and ST_CRNM encode and
decode integers and real numbers.

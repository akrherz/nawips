This parameter library contains subroutines to compute 
meteorological parameters for arrays of data.  These subroutines 
are used by the grid diagnostics package to calculate parameters.
They may also be called directly by application programs, provided 
that the programmer is careful to use the subsetting capabilities 
properly.  In each subroutine, SUBFLG is a logical array.  At each
point, if SUBFLG is true, the calculation will be made; if it is 
false, no calculation will be done.

Note that this library is derived from the PR library.  Therefore,
changes made in either library should also be made in the other.


The following constants are used in the computations:

    RKAPPA = Poisson's constant              = 2 / 7

         G = Gravitational constant          = 9.80616 m/sec/sec

     GAMMA = Standard atmospheric lapse rate = 6.5 K/km

     RDGAS = Gas constant for dry air        = 287.04 J/K/kg

Many of the conversion algorithms are taken from:

The GEMPAK data conversion library provides functions to convert
data from one type of machine to another.  

The functions, MV_SWP4 and MV_SWP2, swap bytes for data being
transferred to or from VAX machines.

Functions to convert 32-bit real numbers to and from IEEE, IBM, or
VAX data types are also included.  These functions are called 
MV_XY32 and convert from machine type X to machine type Y.  X and Y
have the following meanings:

            E      IEEE
            I      IBM
            V      VMS

The subroutine, ST_ETOA, in the string library, can be used to
convert EBCDIC to ASCII.

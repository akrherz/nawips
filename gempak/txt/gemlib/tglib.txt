                  Grid Time (TG) Library 
 
 
The GEMPAK GRID TIME library subroutines process grid times for 
GEMPAK.
 
The GEMPAK format for grid time is a character string:

    YYMMDD/HHMMthhhmm
 
        YY      last two digits of the year 
        MM      month                       
        DD      day of month
        /       date and time separator
        HH      hour                        
        MM      minute
        t       type  ( F=forecast, A=analysis, G=guess, 
                        I=initialization )
        hhh     forecast hour
        mm      forecast minute
 
The string before the / is the DATE; the string after the / is the 
TIME; "thhhmm" is the FORECAST TIME.

If  hhhmm  is one or two characters, they will be interpreted as
hours.  Three or more characters will be right justified in hhhmm.

The forecast type may specify V for verification time.  In this
case,  hhhmm  will be subtracted from the DATE and TIME and the
type will be returned as  F.
 
A partial time may be entered for the grid time.  The last time in
the data set will be used to fill in the missing parts.  If the 
input string does not contain the date and time separator, '/', 
the input string is assumed to be a left-justified time (i.e., 12 
represents HH).  If the forecast type is not specified, the forecast
time from the last time will be used.  FIRST and LAST can be used to 
specify the first and last times in the file.

        If the last time in the file is  890408/1200F72,
        the abbreviated forms will be translated into the 
        following GEMPAK times:

        3/11          ---->       890403/1100F72

        00F00         ---->       890408/0000F00

        7/            ---->       890407/1200F72

        LAST          ---->       890408/1200F72

        LASTF00       ---->       890408/1200F00

        F12           ---->       890408/1200F12

        9/00V48       ---->       890407/1200F48

                     Level (LV) Library 


The LEVEL library processes user input for vertical level and 
vertical coordinate.

LV_INPT translates the user inputs for LEVELS and VCOORD into a
list of levels.  The input for LEVELS may be a list separated by 
semicolons.  The following items may be included in the list:

             a single level;
             MAN for the mandatory levels below 100 mb;
             VAS for the standard VAS levels;
             a range of levels with an increment.

The following items are also valid, provided they are not part of
a list:

             ALL for all levels;
             a range of levels without an increment.

The flag /MAN may be used after any specification of LEVELS so
that any application will use only mandatory level data with no
interpolation.

The TERMINAL library provides subroutines to write messages to the 
user's terminal and to read terminal input.

The subroutines TM_INT, TM_REAL and TM_CHR write a message to the 
terminal and return the integer, real or character array that was 
input by the user.  TM_STR returns a single, unprocessed string. 
TM_ACCP waits for the user to respond by entering a carriage return.  
In every case, the user may type EXIT to stop processing.

Subroutines to clear the terminal screen, halt program execution
and write messages are also available.

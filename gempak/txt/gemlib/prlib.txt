The parameter library contains functions to compute meteorological
parameters.  These functions are used by the PC subroutine package 
to convert parameters and may also be called directly by application
programs.

The library was designed to provide easy access to standard 
meteorological conversions.  Any desired change to a parameter 
conversion function, either to add precision or make a correction,
which is made to a PR function will then be effective throughout 
GEMPAK when the executable code is relinked.


The following constants are used in the computations:

    RKAPPA = Poisson's constant              = 2 / 7

         G = Gravitational constant          = 9.80616 m/sec/sec

     GAMMA = Standard atmospheric lapse rate = 6.5 K/km

     RDGAS = Gas constant for dry air        = 287.04 J/K/kg


Many of the conversion algorithms are taken from:

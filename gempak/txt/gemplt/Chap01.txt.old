GEMPLT is a general plotting subroutine package that provides the
applications programmer with device independent line drawing
capabilities.  It has been designed to simplify the plotting of
meteorological data.  New graphic devices can be added easily.

GEMPLT allows plotting in a variety of coordinate systems.  The
transformations from one coordinate system to another are handled
internally.  Lines, text, markers, wind barbs, and arrows can be
plotted in any coordinate system.  Utility functions to draw
contours, streamlines, and geopolitical maps are available.

GEMPLT has been designed to be extremely flexible for applications
programmers developing either single programs or large
applications systems.  Programs can be written that are
independent of graphics device and map projection, both of which
can be selected at run time.  New features, coordinate systems, and
graphics devices can be added easily without affecting existing
applications programs.

The GEMPLT subroutines communicate with two subprocesses that are
maintained as separate modules.  Coordinate transformations and
utility functions are included in the first subprocess called
GPLT.  The second subprocess is a device driver that draws lines,
text, and symbols.  The device characteristics that are needed by
GPLT are defined in the device driver.  A new device driver must
be written for each graphics device.  Since the subprocesses can
remain active after an applications program exits, plotting
characteristics defined in one program may be used in other
programs that follow it in the same session.

This document provides information for an applications programmer.
An introduction to GEMPLT subroutine descriptions and examples are
included.

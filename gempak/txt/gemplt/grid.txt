A grid is a two-dimensional data set.  GEMPLT supports grids that are
evenly spaced on a map or graph projection.  To plot grid data, the
projection originally used, when the grid was created, must be defined
to GEMPLT.  If the grid was set on a graph projection, subroutine GSGGRF
is called.  If the grid was set on a map projection, subroutine GSGMAP
or GSGPRJ is called.

Currently set grid projections are queried by calls to GQGGRF, GQGMAP,
and GQGPRJ.

After the grid projection is set, G coordinates may be transformed into
any other coordinates.  For example, when a map projection is also set,
a particular row/column location on the grid is transformed into
latitude/longitude by GTRANS when a G-to-M transformation is carried
out.  When plotting grid data, calling the plot functions with the
points in G coordinates performs this transformation as the data points
are plotted.

Following is a list of the exceptions that can occur when calling GEMPLT
subroutines.  The list includes the error code numbers, the error
mnemonics used internally by GEMPLT, and the error messages.

In general, positive error numbers indicate non-fatal conditions while
negative numbers indicate fatal situations.  See Chapter 2 for a
discussion of error processing.

The error codes and error message texts in the list below come from file
$GEMERR/gemplt.err.  The corresponding mnemonics are defined in file
$GEMINC/error.prm.

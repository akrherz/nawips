Contours can be filled or not filled.  Subroutine GCLGRN draws the
simplest (unfilled) contours through a grid of data.  Subroutine GCFILL
draws filled contours.  And subroutine GCBOXX uses a "box fill" to fill
contours.  The box fill (small boxes drawn with simple lines) comes out
looking like a cross-hatch pattern.

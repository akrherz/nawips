X/Y plots of functions, polar (R/THETA) plots, and vertical profile
plots are drawn in graph mode (set by GINITP or by GSMODE).

Before the axes are drawn, the graph coordinates are defined by a call
to GSGRAF.  Currently set graph coordinates are queried by a call to
GQGRAF.  There may be margins around the graph.

GSGMGN defines margins for the graph mode.  The margins are usually set
at about the same time as the M coordinate system is defined.  The
margins remain set for the life of the coordinate system; calls to
change the margins have no effect until the coordinate system is
redefined.  Margins are specified as either fractions of the plot space
or as multiples of the currently set text character size.  Currently set
graph margins are queried by calls to GQGMGN.

Graph axes are drawn by calls to GAAXIS or GDAXIS.

The data on a graph may be drawn a number of ways.  Line graphs can be
done using simple lines (GLINE).  Discrete points may be drawn with
markers (GMARK).  Layers in a vertical profile may be filled polygons
(GFILL).

The appearance of graph axes and data points on a graph is controlled by
changing attributes of lines, tick marks, text, and colors.

The subroutines in this group are used for initialization, termination,
and changing modes.

GINITP is the first subroutine called by any program that uses GEMPLT.
The first time this initialization routine is called, the GPLT sub-
process is spawned and communication is set up between the program and
the sub-process.  When, at a later time, a user executes another program
from the same window, the second program's call to GINITP establishes
communication with the same GPLT sub-process.

As GINITP is called, a mode is specified.  Mode 1 indicates that
plotting will be done in Earth (latitude/longitude) coordinates.  Mode
2 is used for drawing graph (X/Y) plots.  Graphs may not be defined or
drawn in Earth mode and map projections may not be defined or plotted
in graph mode.  The transformations for both modes are retained in GPLT.

The mode may be changed during a program's execution at any time by a
call to GSMODE.  As the mode is changed, the appropriate transformations
are activated internally to GEMPLT.  The currently set mode is
determined by calling GQMODE.

GENDP is the last GEMPLT subroutine called by an application program.
An option exists to stop GPLT and the device driver sub-processes or to
retain them for programs executed later.  GENDP also causes any data,
buffered internally by GEMPLT, to be flushed.

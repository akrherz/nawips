A satellite or radar image is displayed by GEMPLT using the native
projection of the image.  Anything plotted over the image, that is to be
geo-located with the image, must be transformed into the same
projection.  Therefore, when an image is rendered, its navigation
defines the M coordinate system.

An image's navigation is typically retrieved from the image file by
calling subroutine IM_SIMG.  The image's navigation is defined to GEMPLT
with a call to GSATMG.  Key information about the image is also sent to
the device driver by a call to GSICMN.  Currently set navigation is
queried with a call to GQSATN.

An image is displayed with a call to GSATIM.

For plotting maps, latitude/longitude grids, or weather data over an
image, the map projection is set by a call to GSMMAP with the input
parameter PROJ equal to DEF.

Once a projection is defined and a map file is set, the map is drawn by
calling GDRMAP.  A latitude/longitude grid is typically drawn at the
same time by calling GDRGRD.

GEMPLT includes several map data files as discussed in Appendix B of
this manual.  Subroutine GQMFIL returns the name of the currently set
map file.  An alternate map file is set by calling GSMFIL.

Streamlines are drawn by calling subroutine GSTRML.

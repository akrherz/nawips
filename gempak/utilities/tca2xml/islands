<!--  
      This file contains a list of Island Breakpoints that can be specified for Tropical
      Cyclone Watches and Warnings.  The information for each Island breakpoint is included
      in an <island> tag.  The <island> tag must contain one <breakpoint> tag, one or more <path>
      tags, and may contain an optional <landZones> tag.
      
      The <breakpoint> tag is used to identify a unique breakpoint and has required attributes:
      name, state, country, and location.  The value of the "name" attribute must be unique among
      all of the breakpoints.
      
      The <path> tags are used to specify the longitude/latitude coordinate pairs used to draw a 
      line path depicting the geographic area covered by a watch 
      or warning for the breakpoint.  Coordinate pairs must be specified with east longitude first,
      then latitude separated by a comma.  Any number of coordinate pairs can be used in the path,
      and they should be separated by a "space".  Multiple <path> tags can be used to draw separate
      line paths.
      
      The <landZone> tag is optional for each breakpoint, and it is used to specify any
      forecast zones associated with the breakpoint.  If specified, these land zones will 
      be included in the UGC group of a Tropical Cyclone VTEC (TCV) product, if there is
      a watch/warning issued for the associated breakpoint.

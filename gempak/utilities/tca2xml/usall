      This file contains a list of Coast Breakpoints that can be specified for Tropical
      Cyclone Watches and Warnings.  The <coast> tag is used to identify different geographic
      coastlines.  Within the coastline, the information for each breakpoint is included
      in a <segment> tag, and each segment is assumed to be ordered geographically along 
      the coastline.  That is, the geographic information included with a breakpoint is
      assumed to valid for the segment between the current breakpoint and the next one in 
      the list.  Note that for coastlines that are islands, breakpoints are ordered clockwise
      around the island.
      
      The <segment> tag must contain one <breakpoint> tag, one <path> tag, and may contain 
      an optional <landZones> tag.   
      
      The <breakpoint> tag is used to identify a unique breakpoint and has required attributes:
      name, state, country, location, and official.  The value of the "name" attribute must be 
      unique among all of the breakpoints.
      
      The <path> tags are used to specify the longitude/latitude coordinate pairs used to draw a 
      line path depicting the geographic area covered by a watch 
      or warning for the breakpoint segment.  Coordinate pairs must be specified with east 
      longitude first, then latitude separated by a comma.  Any number of coordinate pairs can 
      be used in the path, and they should be separated by a "space".
      
      The <landZone> tag is optional for each breakpoint, and it is used to specify any
      forecast zones associated with the breakpoint segment.  If specified, these land zones will 
      be included in the UGC group of a Tropical Cyclone VTEC (TCV) product, if there is
      a watch/warning issued for the associated breakpoint.

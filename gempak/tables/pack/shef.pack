!Original NWSM 10-944 Table 1 SHEF parameters
!
! # 1   PP = Total precipitation (IN) 'TPCI' 
! # 2   PT = Type of precipitation 'SHPT'
! # 3   HG = River stage height (FT) 'RSHF'
! # 4   SF = Depth of fresh snow (IN) 'SNEW'
! # 5   SD = Total snow depth (IN) 'SNOW'
! # 6   SW = Water equivalent of snow (IN) 'WEQS'
! # 7, 8 & 9
!       TA = Dry bulb temperature (F) 'TMPF' Minimum 'TDNF' and Maximum 'TDXF'
! # 10  TM = Wet bulb temperature (F) 'TMWF'
! # 11  TD = Dew point temperature (F) 'DWPF'
! # 12  TW = Water temperature (F) 'WTMF'
! # 13  XR = Relative humidity (%) 'RELH'
! # 14  UD = Wind direction (degrees) 'DRCT'
! # 15  US = Wind speed (miles/hour) 'SMPH'
! # 16  UG = Wind gust speed at time of observation ( in miles per hour) 'GMPH'
! # 17  UR = Peak wind direction (degrees) 'PWDR' 
! # 18  UP = Peak wind speed (miles/hour) 'PMPH'
! # 19 & 20
!       UQ = Combined wind direction and speed (in format SSS.SDDD where SSS.S is 
!       speed in miles per hour and DDD is direction in degrees) 'CWDS' - 2 parameters
!       combined wind direction 'WDIR' and speed 'WSPD'
!
! # 21  PA = Pressure in inches of mercury (They are often reported in millibars 'PRSI'
! # 22  PL = MSL pressure in inches of mercury (often reported in mb) 'PMSI'
! # 23  XW = Present weather 'WWMO'
! # 24  XP = Past weather 'PWWM'
! # 25  XV = Horizontal visibility (miles) 'VSBY'
!
! Total of 25 parameters from SHEF are decoded and converted to GEMPAK sfc file
! HR24 is the additional 26th parameter just to indicate the time duration interval
! which is always 24 here.

     SKPMIS

     SKPMIS is a logical variable which indicates whether non-reporting 
     stations will be listed.

     If SKPMIS is YES, nonreporting stations will not be listed.  
     Otherwise, all stations will be listed.

     In SFMAP, markers can be plotted at nonreporting stations when 
     SKPMIS is NO.

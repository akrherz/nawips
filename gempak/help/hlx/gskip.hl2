     GSKIP 

     GSKIP allows the NDFDG2 user to specify a skip factor in order
     to reduce the resolution of the resulting GEMPAK grid.
 
     Any positive integer may be specified.  This skip factor will 
     be applied to both the I and J dimensions.

     A warning will be issued if no value is specified and the 
     resulting grid is too large.

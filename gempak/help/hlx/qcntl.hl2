     QCNTL

     QCNTL is the quality control threshold values.  It is used only
     when the first-guess field exists. If the difference between 
     the original data and the interpolated values from the first guess 
     is greater than the threshold values, the data will be discarded.
     Only positive threshold values are used. The default value is 0.

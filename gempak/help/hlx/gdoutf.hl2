     GDOUTF

     GDOUTF is the output grid data file name.

     GDOUTF is used in programs which create a new grid data file.  It 
     is also used in programs that move data from an input file to an 
     output file.  In that case, GDFILE is the original file.

     The file types that can be used for GDFILE cannot be used to
     specify the GDOUTF value.

     MIXRLN

     MIXRLN specifies the color, line type, line width, minimum, maximum, 
     and increment for the background mixing ratio lines on thermodynamic
     diagrams:

	line color / line type / width / minimun / maximum / increment

     The values should be separated by slashes.  If the color is 0, or 
     MIXRLN is blank, no lines will be drawn.

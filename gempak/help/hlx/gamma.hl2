     GAMMA

     GAMMA, the convergence parameter, is a multiplier for the weight and 
     search radius for passes after the first pass of the Barnes analysis 
     programs.  GAMMA must be within the range 0 - 1.  Any value outside 
     this range will default to a value of 0.3.  If GAMMA is 0, the number 
     of passes will be set to 1.  The recommended value for GAMMA is 0.3.

     BUFRFIL

     BUFRFIL is the BUFR output file names in the format of

	BUFRFIL = ...;...;...
	       or blank

     where the individual items are the BUFR output file names 
     corresponding to the individual FXYTBL file name (e.g., 
     JUBf99.YYYYMMDDHH;JUFf00.YYYYMMDDHH) and the blank means that 
     the output file names are gotten from the master table based 
     on the requested FXY file names.

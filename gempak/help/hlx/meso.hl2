     MESO

     MESO specifies the plot symbol and filter attributes for
     mesocyclones:

           color / marker / size / width / hw ; filter

     A color value of 0 is used to turn off mesocyclone plotting.
    
     Marker attributes behave as MARKER for other plotting programs.

     FILTER is a logical variable or real number which controls the
     filtering of data in order to control plotting of overlapping
     data.

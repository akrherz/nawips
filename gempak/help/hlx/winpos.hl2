     WINPOS

     WINPOS specifies the position for plotting winds for vertical
     profile plots.  Up to three separate wind profiles may be plotted.
     The stability indices will also be positioned at the top of the
     plot according to WINPOS.  Position 1 is the leftmost position.
     The value of WINPOS will be incremented modulo 3 until the screen
     is cleared or the program is run again.
